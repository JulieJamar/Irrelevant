After receiving information on the problem this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove then the after sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant
Otherwise if physical intervention is not necessary which is mostly the case then Sûti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant
So first they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove then they will change the engine s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant
When they are done they check if the stove is operational,Relevant
If so the after sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant
If not then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically thus Sûti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
When the welder load is planned he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant
First of all the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant
After that several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant
On the one hand the quality manager will design the quality plan,Relevant
On the other hand the design engineer will first analyze the file in order to be able to draw the nomenclature of the project,Relevant
After that the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task executed by the design engineer,Relevant
When all the questions will be covered it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant
Now it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant
If the customer has other questions he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
If the customer approves the drawing the company will receive an email from him,Relevant
After having received the customer approbation the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
After that the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant
The plan as built will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
It is important to know that Into this process each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
Then they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant
In fact they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant
If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant
Once this is done we can send the request for a quote,Relevant
When the purchasing department receives the quote it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Once the order is received by the storekeeper he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant
If a control card exists then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
If the order is non compliant then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non compliance,Relevant
Once this is completed the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant
At another time the billing department will receive the invoice of the order which will start their process,Relevant
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant
The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources internal or external audit report management review customer complaint non compliance suggestion etc,Relevant
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager QAM,Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
It is important to detect the issue which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the QAM,Relevant
Then the QAM will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
When the amelioration file is finished the QAM will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant
If there is no improvement needed the QAM will answer to the improvement demand applicant with if possible an explanation for the refusal,Relevant
However if an improvement is needed the QAM will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined the QAM will inform the direction,Relevant
When the direction is informed of the issue she provides the necessary means and then launches the action,Relevant
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
In parallel the QAM follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant
When the improvement action is finished the QAM checks the effectiveness of the action implemented ie checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant
If the result is satisfying the improvement action process ends there,Relevant
Otherwise the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met ,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at no significant cost is not possible,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at low cost is possible but the problem is recurrent,Irrelevant
Immediate low cost repair is possible but can lead to an opportunity for improvement,Irrelevant
Supplier defect which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors,Irrelevant
Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a complaint sheet is completed and if necessary a non conformity sheet is completed,Irrelevant
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non conformity,Relevant
Next they have to fill in the non conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM Project manager,Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
If the answer is no the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant
If it is approved the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant
If the client doesn t accept it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
He will close the NCS remove the marking non conformity and notify the QAM who shall verify the process make analysis,Relevant
After the analysis if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken they will make a new one,Relevant
If not they will archive the non conformity,Relevant
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client s equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
The project manager asks the management for an approval and depending what the management will decide the client s request will be approved or not,Relevant
If the request is rejected the project manager will send a rejection to the client otherwise the process continues and the project s file is created with an ERP s number,Relevant
Then the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Finally with all the information received the project manager makes the quote and then asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant
Afterward the project manager establishes the offer which is registered in the ERP and sends it to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer the project manager receives the order form,Relevant
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
The contract is reviewed by the project manager the file is prepared and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation registration process is ended,Relevant
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
Indeed they have to write several articles for the next day s daily journal,Irrelevant
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received for example through the alert us button of their website,Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
Therefore if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant
Once the subject is received or chosen the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant
We will consider Liège s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Liège s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
However if the information comes from the alert us button the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant
A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant
If a journalist were to obtain crucial information it must be published even partially as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant
Thus it is directly posted on Sudpresse s paying website,Relevant
On the contrary if the information can wait the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant
Once it is done the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point to know what he should search next,Relevant
In both cases phone calls emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
Sometimes as demonstrated in the previous process information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant
That is why the information written as quickly as possible will be briefly explained on Sudpresse s paying website,Irrelevant
Following this event a strategic marketing employee in the newsroom creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant
This teasing includes a link to the company s paying website,Irrelevant
Afterwards the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website adding information and upgrading the layout until it is complete and perfect,Relevant
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
If he gets new information from a tier he contacts this tier that becomes thus one of a source or any other source who can verify clarify this new information,Relevant
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
Compared to a few years ago journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
Then once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites and when due to the tight timing the article must be finished to be in the next day s newspaper the journalist asks for a page of the next day s daily journal and starts copying the article s content,Relevant
Before every publication digital or paper the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant
Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant
First relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant
Then these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant
Once this step is operated the rotary press is switched on,Relevant
Then plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers  pages are printed,Relevant
At this stage a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
During the whole work of the machine printing assembling  the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
First we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant
Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01 00 am they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
Once the newspapers are in those centers vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
This must take place before 7 30am as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries 7am at the latest as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
Through this process description we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant
Nowadays writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant
Therefore various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant
Nevertheless thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant
We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website which format which size which colors which position on the page etc,Relevant
The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly these people s background and profile by using big data,Relevant
Once the advertising spots have been defined it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant
Using the data previously collected sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
On the newspaper they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page half a page or an entire page knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant
In this case advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company ending with a link to the company s website,Relevant
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
An advertisement may appear one or multiple times depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant
Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant
When it is done the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
If it is not the contract is reviewed,Relevant
A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a PoivreSel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer s usual point of sale,Relevant
If the client doesn t call his her usual point of sale the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant
If the client is a new or a usual one 10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant
Afterwards he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant
If none of the employees is available the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the employee answering the call determines the type category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant
It is then the job of the franchisor CEO to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
If information is missing he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of PoivreSel Teamleader,Relevant
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
When the payment is completed the employees can start the order,Relevant
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
After this discussion he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
If he decides to continue then Mr Buche will take him on a day long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant
After that day both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
If they continue the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant
Once this is done the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant
Once he has found it he will show it to Mr Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant
If it is not the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant
If it is the calculations are sent to the franchisee s accountant for validation,Relevant
Once validated it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
Then we see if the idea is appreciated if not we stop,Relevant
If it is appreciated the franchisee who had the idea suggests to make a vote,Relevant
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
If the majority raises their hands we make the recipe if not the requested is rejected,Relevant
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at PoivreSel to eat,Relevant
First of all the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant
If the customer eats on the spot the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant
Once the order is taken the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
Then the waiter waits until the customer s meal is over ie when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
If the customer has taken out the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
If a product is missing from PoivreSel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available the office manager checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant
If the product is available we ask for the quantity of this product x at PoivreSel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at PoivreSel,Relevant
If the product is no longer available the supplier asks for salt and pepper if he wants to order if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information invoice delivery date by e mail,Relevant
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
He goes to the line manager who welcomes him then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant
Later the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant
He begins his training and medical supervision and the process is over for him,Relevant
If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months it is considered as a first contract,Relevant
Therefore the worker is registered at the guard post then he is greeted by the head of the department who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant
Later the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant
If an IT account must be created the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant
If not the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
Then an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator his release date is encoded on HR Access the human resources management software package,Relevant
The C4 the unemployment certificate and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
After that the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant
Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses  managers before 10 am to conclude it,Relevant
Later he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank s website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
Finally the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
if the manager has received the evaluations he must review them otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant
If the assessment is understandable the plant HR director if we need training if so we set up training and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant
If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre software then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
If the candidates respond to the applications of the function they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant
If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
First of all the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside supermarkets small shops ,Relevant
Then Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant
If it does not have them it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant
The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant
Once the products are available the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant
As far as the recruitment process is concerned it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant
For operators Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2 sometimes 3 interviews with the applicant,Relevant
The first one is with the direct manager ie the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company s managers,Relevant
Following this second interview they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
About 50 people are employed in production and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant
Goumanisto s objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
Finally the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes both operations are still done manually,Relevant
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
Indeed the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant
RD is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
Then they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently they are validated by the RD department and presented to the general council,Relevant
On the other hand if they could not be profitable everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
Then he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency s database,Relevant
If a matching profile has been found the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If he has not been employed the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant
If one is found the loop is going again,Relevant
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
Indeed when the client wants a very specific candidate the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant
When the job does not require any specific skills the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant
Whether it would be a specific or a non specific job when a candidate respondsto the announcement the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If the candidate has not been employed the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant
However if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant
Indeed the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap the client has to warn Asap,Relevant
So when Asap receives a message from the client the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
After the phone call the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
If so the process ends,Relevant
If a meeting has been agreed the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant
On the convenued day the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
So the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant
Before discussing specific topics of the job he has to check the candidate references,Relevant
After the discussion the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
After the meeting the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency there are two possibilities,Relevant
On one hand if the feedback is bad the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant
In this case the process ends,Relevant
On the other hand if the feedback is good the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant
After sending the message the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
In this case the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant
When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client the process can start,Relevant
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
When the bank receives the message from ASAP she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate s bank account,Relevant
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
If it is the case the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant
On the side of the agency if she doesn t receive a message from the candidate the process is fulfilled but when a payment error message is received the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant
When the candidate has not been paid enough the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If the candidate has been too much paid the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant
So the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant
We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
After the phone call the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant
On the said date the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant
So the superior can start the meeting,Relevant
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
Then he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant
After that the superior can end the meeting,Relevant
When the meeting is finished and the employee is left the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant
From there there are three possibilities,Relevant
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
After each possibility the process ends,Relevant
We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances,Irrelevant
When the agency has given a service to one of his clients a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery,Irrelevant
If the invoice is not correct the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant
If the invoice is correct the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant
When the invoice has been sent the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant
If the payment arrives within 5 days the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not the case the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant
After this call if the payment has been completed within 5 days the process ends,Relevant
If not the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
To finish the process there are two possibilities,Relevant
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above,Irrelevant
The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs get a response from the client charge him and inform DJM,Relevant
The first contact always starts within Proximus stores but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over firstly the manager,Relevant
The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant
If the customer refuses the offer the process is over,Relevant
On the other hand if the customer is interested in the pack the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs S M L,Relevant
These packs are categorized according to their size options and functionality,Irrelevant
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
Once the customer has made his choice the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer s new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies DJM and Proximus,Relevant
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
When the website is prepared it is sent to the customer who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant
If the client is satisfied with the website it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant
If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days a reminder message is sent,Relevant
This process starts when the client who has already chosen either the M pack or the L pack is interested in receiving an e shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
After invoicing in a Proximus shop the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant
Then it s the webmaster who produces the e shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant
This process ends when the e shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant
If he can resolve it directly he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e mail,Relevant
The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant
If the documents are incomplete the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant
If the documents are complete the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired an email is also sent to inform him her of the news,Relevant
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
If he she notices that he she is missing data he she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant
Then he creates the contract which he then sends,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
Then the first task is made by the Head of department who has to give specific criteria of the job requirements skills needed,Relevant
Once the task is completed the HR employee has to see if it is a specific more special demand or not,Relevant
Usually for nurses they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant
For more specific functions they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant
For more special requests for example energy engineer they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant
After having collected the CV the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department s criteria,Relevant
If there are a lot of applications he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant
Due to the written exam he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant
Once the task is completed he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant
If he didn t approve it a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant
The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant
If he doesn t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant
Finally the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant s information and create the employment contract,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished = applicant employed,Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood pressure and so on,Relevant
These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service which allows the doctor even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant
The doctor specialist has to check the patient s data,Relevant
based on that he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant
If he considers that it is not urgent he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant
Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
Finally the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax usually to the pharmacy,Relevant
In all hospitals there is a pharmacy so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant
The pharmacy checks if they have everything usually they have everything,Relevant
If some medications are missing they have to inform the nurse of the product s non availability,Relevant
Then they have to check the availability of the medications in another service and send someone to take them,Relevant
Once they have received the medications they have to notify the nurse prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant
The last task is made by the nurse who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant
Once the task is done the process is finished = medications prepared,Relevant
There are several possible cases ,Irrelevant
In case of end of contract At the end of the contract replacement contract fixed term contract there is nothing is simply over for the employee,
In case of dismissal Dismissal can be caused by many things usual causes,Relevant
If the dis missal is sufficiently justified HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant
In the event of a decision to discontinue e,Relevant
redirection to another hospital It is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flémalle this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant
However the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant
When a patient wishes to make an appointment he can do so through three different channels this can be done by phone by mail or on the spot at the counter,Relevant
In all three cases the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant
However if it is done by e mail it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant
The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient then an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
The patient has to pay directly on the spot he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant
After waiting in the waiting room the doctor sees the patient,Relevant
He will check the patient s medical history in the CPR computerized patient record examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant
Eventually the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software Carpark,Irrelevant
Indeed Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries the number plate the intern references but also the location of the maintenance the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers  Moreover drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers depending on the bus,Relevant
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
Of course more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant
Lastly Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
With this complaint a driver signals a damage a breakdown or an accident after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant
The content of the complaint is the following the problem the vehicle concerned its kilometers travelled and if the driver wants to his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant
If the problem is considered as urgent the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant
Otherwise the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant
If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant
Following the daily planning of the mechanics the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant
With the use of a clocking software each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant
That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant
Moreover the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock,Relevant
Once the mechanic has finished the repairs the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
Of course in order to make repairs on busses it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant
It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders communicate them to the suppliers take the delivery control and approve the invoices,Relevant
Once a new piece arrives either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent or the piece enters the stock,Relevant
Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair as mentioned previously and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement a shelf and a level,Relevant
Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don t own any cistern,Irrelevant
This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software Telenaro where the internal tanks are continuously updated and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant
Telenaro gathers all the societies vehicles of the group internal and external drivers and data related type of vehicle maximum level of the fuel tank baseline consumption current consumption and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant
That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations vehicles and cisterns,Relevant
Moreover the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant
Lastly Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel the deltas given by the probes see further the alerts from problems during a delivery etc,Relevant
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on live view of the fuel level,Relevant
In parallel to the probes the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant
The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles ie the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption in winter a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars ,Irrelevant
The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft which triggers an alarm,Relevant
It even gives the level of water in the cistern due to the condensation in the cisterns so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
Most importantly the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
To know if any tankage is required the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars see the adjacent illustration,Irrelevant
In addition the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant
