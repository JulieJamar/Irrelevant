All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant
After the tankage the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant
If they do not correspond the system asks the delivery man to re encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant
After three times asking for re encodage if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant
Then the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant
The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for ,Relevant
Rolling stock buses for regular lines scholar lines tourisms but also trailers for the luggages ,Relevant
No rolling stock supplies for the garages tools compressors ,Relevant
Properties buildings but also air conditioning garage doors led lights bus wash ,Relevant
IT infrastructures cabling laptops desktops servers magnetic access cards surveillance cameras ,Relevant
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
Once the investment request is completed the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant
If the management validates the purchase the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant
Once the investment request has been signed it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant
In order to close the process the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant
The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant
Of course case by case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant
In fact 76 of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant
For example all the OPEX Operational Expenditures that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant
If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier in order to compare the price quality ratios the delivery time the quality of the after sales service etc,Relevant
here again exceptions are of course possible,Irrelevant
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
Besides those master contracts the company also has some price conventions and other pre negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant
Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
Once the information has been collected through market analysis the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant
The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant
After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested a first offer is created,Relevant
This offer needs to be signed by several managers if the offer is not appropriated it might compromise the sale,Relevant
After having been signed the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant
If the client directly accepts the offer the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant
But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant
Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain but that almost never occurs generally if the second offer is still not validated by the client the sale is cancelled,Relevant
At the beginning of each month the account of more than 40 small societies that all kept their legal entity need to be closed in 4 working days,
To do so a lot of accountants work in the subsidiaries and each of them close two or three files within 4 days,
Their work mainly consists in verifying and gathering the invoices as well as the charges,
For the invoices the ones that concern the regular services and the scholar services come directly from the manager at the moment of the service provision and immediately verified by the accountant,
On the other side for the taxis the tourism sector invoices to be drawn up are used because the very end of the service needs to be reached in order to know the total costs engaged,
For the charges the accountants have to look into the salaries and wages,
In the organisation those are based on the real pay on what has actually been paid with almost no accounting provisions,
All the other types of charges are also taken into account rent provisions fuel costs charges from invoices that still need to be drawn up properties maintenance  As mentioned right above within 4 working days starting at the 1st of the month the accountants have to close their files and send them to the management accountants for verification and for a fist analysis,
Keolis Belgium comprises 3 management accountants one for Wallonia one for Flanders and one for Brussel,
Thus on the 4th of the month they verify the work of the accountants according to the budgetization of the month and the year the fluctuations from month to month etc,
They have a more global vision that is both operational and budgetary,
After receiving the approval from the management accountants the accountants inject the files in BOFINANCE the reporting tool used by Keolis SA that has its headquarters in France,
The headquarter then consolidates the accounts and adds on top operations such as adjusted depreciation expenses to make those accounts correspond to the International Financial Reporting Standards,
The 3 management accountants then receive the consolidated accounts consolidate them again into 3 reports one for each region and a second analysis takes place estimation of the gaps between the non consolidated and the consolidated accounts identification of the impact of the events of the month ie the price variation of the fuel on the turnover as well as on each part of the business of the organisation scolar part tourism part regular services part  etc,
This analysis is a from the real to the budget analysis a waterfall of all the impacts is made in order to obtain the budget of the month,
Currently the impact of the covid crisis is at the center of those monthly analyses,
If the impact on scholar transportation is relatively small the one on the tourism sector is huge since all the activities are stationary,
Moreover the reinforcements asked by La TEC that needed more vehicles also have had consequences,
On the 5th day of the month the management accountants send the 3 reports to the directors of each region,
It is indeed important that the results of their analysis are communicated with the operational managers,
Finally on the 6th day of the month the management accountant of Wallonia consolidates the 3 reports in order to obtain one consolidated report for Belgium which is required by the headquarter in France,
Empty bottles are returned by the customers once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant
If the bottles have defects they are rejected and if not they are kept,Relevant
Then the bottles are filled captured labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
The suppliers check the order if it is accepted a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev then the suppliers plan the transportation then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant
Once the trucks are received AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods if everything is good the bottles are stored if not AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks check the goods before storing them,Relevant
purchase order is received at the logistics department if it is a new customer it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant
The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant
If everything is available the order is prepared otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant
Once the beer is ready it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant
AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels Indeed and Forem the People department receives applications,Relevant
1 CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company and when information is missing we send an e mail to warn the candidate,Relevant
If they do not meet the criteria their application will not have been selected,Relevant
2 The telephone interview the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone 5 10 minutes,Relevant
If he is convinced he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant
3 The recruitment morning is a collective interview there is a series of tests,Relevant
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N+1 or N+2,Relevant
4 Interview with the department manager The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
If the candidate is accepted he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant
5 Form Alim training Form Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant
6 The first seasonal contract and coaching When signing the contract the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant
7 The permanent contract If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
After this step we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer then we will cool the beer filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature 3 weeks before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
The aim of this process is to answer positively or not to an employee s holiday request,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to pending which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant
Then the request is sent to the manager of the requester s department,Relevant
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
If the manager rejects the request the analyst changes its state to rejected and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant
Otherwise if the manager accepts the request the analyst changes the state of the request to approved and the first step is done,Relevant
After that the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
To understand it properly it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn t already exist,Irrelevant
In the same way we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant
So in the most common cases the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant
Then he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
Otherwise if after trying to create this page the software realizes that this new resource doesn t refer to an existing project the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
After successfully filling each step the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant
In the same way if during the creation of a new project the software realizes that this project doesn t relate to a registered customer then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
After having registered this new customer the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
This is the role of the second and the third start events which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
If the training has not already been taught in the past then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant
cfr linked subprocess,Irrelevant
Otherwise the manager only has to schedule the session of related training called then a session and contact the external trainer of his choice specialized in this field,Relevant
As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant
1 week before the training s day a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant
After the session the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously ask for a debrief apply the post training process and update attendees  skills in the database,Relevant
That being done the whole process finally ends,Relevant
Subprocess If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant
If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons the training being too expensive too time consuming for the human resources etc the manager has to re evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant
Otherwise the manager can select the language the training will be given in French English or both,Relevant
Finally he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the framework which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in Interco which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
After that the accounting officer clicks on the button send to invoice and the invoice is registered as to be received in FICO which is the general accountancy software,Relevant
Finally the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
Once it is received the invoice gets archived,Relevant
If the company finds an interesting profile the HR employee searches for information about them creates a proposal and sends them an email,Relevant
If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks the process ends,Relevant
However if they accept the proposal the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant
Once the interview has been made the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant
Once the visit and the interview have been carried out a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant
Depending on their result the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant
If the answer is yes the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
If the answer is negative a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant
If accepted the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
In the first case the documents of the applicants their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant
In the second case the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant
Based on these documents the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
Indeed to manufacture a pump for a customer they need material resources and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant
Then three activities have to be done in parallel Create an X Flow3 Request for quotation to the supplier Do a framework agreement price matrix it is done to calculate costs of the pump,Relevant
When these 3 tasks are completed the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
If the quality does not meet the expectations they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant
If the quality is good they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant
When the invoice is received they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X Flow which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick off meeting KOM,Relevant
Then the master planner attends the KOM and thanks to the minutes of meeting MOM that he receives by mail he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project s milestones,Relevant
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
Then meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant
In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
Then the business unit makes a project proposal and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
If they say that it is infeasible the process ends,Relevant
But if it is feasible then the business unit the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant
Then those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant
Then they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant
When those tasks are done the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant
Then the three teams above mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
After all these activities the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
When it is done they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre assemble the pump,Relevant
When it is done they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant
Once again they receive a work order and they have to do two activities in parallel do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant
Then when those two activities are done they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant
If the performance is of good quality the pump is dispatched,Relevant
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
If the performance is poor they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
Then they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
If the problem comes from the customer the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant
In the case where the customer is under warranty they apply it,Relevant
If he is not under warranty a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant
If he rejects the quote the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant
The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant
In the case where he accepts the quote or right after having applied the warranty they create a work order WO,Relevant
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
If a big repair has to be done they go on site to do it because of practical reasons then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
If it is only small repairs they do it at Sulzer s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant
Once it is done they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
Before really getting into the recruitment process it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
Applications are received by the HR managers who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant
Once an application is selected an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
Once the candidate has been selected the integration phase begins the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
The integration process On the first day the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant
The employee is given his or her work tools mobile phone PC car and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant
They are told what they need to know about the firm the company s values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
A diagnosis is launched at the customer s premises an employee will describe the company its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
Once the diagnosis has been established the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client s analysis,Relevant
From this moment on improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
Once the diagnosis has been made the areas for improvement put forward it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
Based on this an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant
Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team a project is launched,Relevant
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client s company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
The employees responsible for the project build new tools propose new working methods and processes,Relevant
Workshops are set up at the client s premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company,Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results Resultance employees working at the client s site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
To ensure that the project runs smoothly a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client s internal project manager,Relevant
This makes it possible for example to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant
In addition to this every 4 to 6 weeks a steering committee with the management committee of the client company is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
And finally Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
When a new employee joins the company his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called Workday,Relevant
This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves evaluations sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant
In addition this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
Once a customer has placed an order the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products badge with date of production and expiry date are handled manually,Relevant
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
Then the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
After that the products related to the order can be released,Relevant
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
Then according to the 4 eyes principle another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant
If there is a discrepancy the offer is corrected,Relevant
When the offer is finally approved it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
When this email is received in Belgium the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer ,Relevant
The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
The customer can also place orders by e mailing the company,Relevant
When the e mail is received the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
In case of shortage the customer is of course notified,Relevant
The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI Electronic Data Interchange,Relevant
Once the order is confirmed it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant
After receiving the order the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant
Then a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant
Once the products are picked up they are boxed and packed,Relevant
Then the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
When the products are received by the customer the invoice is sent,Relevant
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
Even if the contact is made by phone an e mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant
Then the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied the right quantity was sent,Relevant
If it is the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant
If the price quantity is not correct the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print sign scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant
Then the customer service also has to print sign scan send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
Due to the digital transformation most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant
So every morning the supply manager when he sees the ERP alert purchases the products missing or practically missing,Relevant
The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote that is a support activity,Relevant
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
Thanks to ERP it is hardly happening,Irrelevant
But if while he is picking products something is missing or the quality is not good enough he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant
Suppliers are listed in the supplier database where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the Customer database,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
If the client does not need delivery or a quote he should go to the cash and carry shop in Droixhe,Relevant
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
If for some reason the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client the financial department will analyze if it could economically be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant
If not the lead will be aborted,Relevant
If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant
Otherwise he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant
When the first quote is made by the salesman or the telemarketer the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant
If the client accepts it the contract will be signed and the order made,Relevant
If not he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed or he might want a better quote,Relevant
The salesman telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
If it is not possible to do a better quote the case will be closed,Relevant
If it is the salesman telemarketer will make the new quote which might once again be approved or refused by the client,Relevant
And so on until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant
When the order arrived at the warehouse if there are some products that need to be pre commanded the manager will do so and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant
Otherwise he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
If the product needed is not there the work must advise the manager so he can report the error corrects the database and purchases the product needed,Relevant
Every time the picker picks something he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant
When all the products of the order are picked the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant
Then if everything is right the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant
If the order is canceled the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer and if the product was not shipped yet the manager will handle the product return,Relevant
When the order is delivered the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant
Then every Monday they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant
If after 14 days they still do not have the payment they will send a reminder,Relevant
If after another 14 days the order is still unpaid the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant
Whether it is by phone or by mail the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant
If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant
After that the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant
To this end the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant
At the same time the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant
In the perspective of an actuarial reservation he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant
In the other perspective the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant
The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable otherwise it s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
In the end a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant

That s why on the insurance side they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant
As seen in the claims management process the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant
Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality also they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant
Otherwise the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant
So for this process when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
Nevertheless to find which model to use the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant
