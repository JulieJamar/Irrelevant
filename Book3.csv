New customer enters our agency,Relevant
We check if he already exists in our database,Relevant
If he exists we propose him our services ,Relevant
If he does not exist we create a new account and then propose our services,Relevant
If he reject our proposal the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts our services we register his demand,Relevant
We give him an appointment,Relevant
After one week he still can refuse the demand or confirm,Irrelevant
Then he receives the command,Relevant
The process is finished,Relevant
The process begins when someone is declaring a damage for which he wants to be compensated,Relevant
For that he has several ways to state the incident,Irrelevant
The choice will impact the way the clerk will address the issue,Irrelevant
The claim management officer will firstly check if the person declaring is an actual client of Ethias,Relevant
For the application or the website channel this check will be done by the person itself,Relevant
Obviously the victim must be a client of Ethias in order to be compensated if not the process ends here by informing the victim the steps that he should follow in order to be eligible for the coverage,Relevant
In some cases when the incident is claimed by phone the clerk starts by asking the victim if he or she needs some support such as a tow truck for instance,Relevant
Then the victim will share key information with the officer of the claims management department to make the declaration,Relevant
The outcome of this computation will be checked by the actuarial control 4,Relevant
If changes are needed the actuary will adjust his model and repeat the computation,Relevant
After the approbation by the actuarial control the assessment of the case is sent to the accounting department in order to be accounted for,Relevant
It s up to the actuary to communicate the reservation to the accounting department,Relevant
To initiate this process a product manager from the marketing or sales department requests to price a product,Relevant
Then the actuary team of the tarification department will gather data and statistics about the type of incidence that the service covers,Relevant
The Ethias database is filled with information in order to develop a technical model of tarification to take into account the specific risks and give a first price for the premium,Relevant
But this price does not always comply with the market demand and customer needs this is the reason why the actuary team and the product manager exchange information to compute a model more suitable for the market,Relevant
This second version of the model will be sent to the actuarial control in order to be reviewed and to check the perspective of profitability with the business plan,Relevant
When the review is done if changes are needed the actuary team takes care of remodelling it and shows the model to the actuarial control once again until it s validated by it,Relevant
This validation must be followed by the agreement of all the stakeholders that are linked with this pricing process,Relevant
Their agreement is necessary before establishing the tariff and sending it to the product manager,Irrelevant
The underwriting process begins when a demand for insurance coverage is perceived by the sales department,Relevant
This demand is sent either by a peer to peer procedure between Ethias and the organisation by a broker as an intermediate of the concerned company or by a tendering procedure on public markets,Relevant
This distinction doesn t change the process in essence but rather in the outcomes and the channel of communication,Irrelevant
Then the demand is transferred into the CRM system of Ethias either by the sales officer or in some cases automatically,Relevant
Next the sales officer checks if this demand comply with the business guidelines of Ethias in strategic or relationship terms,Relevant
Generally the case complies and continues its path towards the underwriting department to follow two successive analysis procedures first an acceptance analysis which is made in order to make the decision to keep such demand or to reject it,Relevant
If the underwriter doesn t accept it then the process ends otherwise he proceeds in a second time to a tarification analysis,Relevant
These two phases are modelled as subprocesses which consist of multiple tasks that should be done before setting the tariff and the offer,Relevant
In addition a competence scheme helps to decide whether the offer needs to be agreed by two other third parties BOL and HAC or not depending on the offer,Irrelevant
They can eventually ask for adjustment before pursuing the process,Relevant
Later on if the third parties agreed when needed the underwriter decides the channel through which he will make the offer,Relevant
Considering the circumstances he has 3 possibilities the offer could either be led directly towards the client through the CRM system be led to an account manager ACMA that will defend the offer in front of the call for tenders or be placed in a share application for the sales department that will handle it from there,Relevant
The outcome of the offer will be communicated through the same channel used to make the offer,Relevant
The last tasks for the underwriter are to settle all the paperwork and then depending on the outcome to classify the case or not if the outcome is negative he must do so if it is positive the onus is not on him to do that and the process is over,Relevant
This process begins when a client requests insurance coverage,Relevant
He has the choice to fill in the subscription form digitally or to have contact with a clerk in an agency or via phone call,Relevant
The sales officer of the front office will define what services the customer needs and check if he is already a client in Ethias,Relevant
If it s not the case the clerk affiliates him by asking for personal information,Relevant
Then the officer will check the client s incident data in DataSure which is a database to centralise all the declared incidences from any insurance company in order to decide if he is eligible for the services needed,Relevant
If he is not eligible the rejection is communicated directly after this verification,Relevant
Either way the clerk makes the first quotation with the information gathered and hands in to the client or sends it via letter or email if the request is made via phone call,Relevant
The client reviews it fills it with extra information needed to establish any contracts and sends it back via the channel of his choice,Relevant
If it is physically then the clerk decides if it meets the criteria of acceptance by analysing the risk,Relevant
The rejection is also communicated to the client after this verification,Relevant
If accepted the clerk makes changes if needed by taking into account the review of the client and the extra information,Relevant
Then the contract is printed and given to the client and waited to be signed,Relevant
If it is digitally the back office takes care of making the verification with the criteria and establishing the contract by taking into account all the data,Relevant
All this procedure is simplified if the client firstly decides to fill the subscription digitally,Relevant
For that he needs to be affiliated and this is made possible thanks to the website or the application,Irrelevant
The subscription form and client s data are sent directly to the back office to be evaluated and analysed,Relevant
The officer checks with the criteria of acceptance and decides whether to send a rejection or to establish and send the contract to be signed by the client,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is sick or absent for whatever reason,Relevant
The first step of the process has to be done by the employee he has to send his medical certificate to the human resources and at the same time he has to contact them in order to inform them of the duration of its absence,Relevant
Thanks to this the human resources can start their own process in which they try to replace him by someone,Relevant
Then after both of these tasks have been completed the next tasks will mainly concern the human resources department,Relevant
They have to sort out the different types of medical certificates check if they are certificates without pathologies or certificates with pathologies,Relevant
On the one hand if and only if the certificate is without any pathology the human resources employee has to check it and verify if the certificate is valid,Relevant
Then he has to verify some little things like the start of the absence the end of it and then he has to send a mail to SPCM to prevent them,Relevant
Following this at the same time he has to encode this absence in the system in order that all the organization can be aware of the absence of the employee and he has to notify the medical advisor too and then the medical advisor will have to choose whether the veracity of this absence must be checked or not,Relevant
On the other hand if and only if this certificate contains pathologies the human resources employee has to send it directly to the Service Provincial de contrôle médical and has to fulfill a form,Relevant
After that the SPCM checks if the certificate is correct and if there is any problem,Relevant
After that he then gives his accord to the organization to encode this,Relevant
So the human resources employee can encode this in the database,Relevant
Afterwards at the same time they have to notify the medical advisor and then the medical advisor chooses to check the veracity of this absence or not and the human resources employee can check the date the absence etc,Relevant
After that in addition they receive the acknowledgement of receipt and finally they can put the certificate in the HR certificate folder and the process is over,Relevant
The process starts at the end of the month when it is time to pay the different employees in the company,Relevant
We should note that almost the entire process is carried out by human resources,Irrelevant
Firstly at the same time the human resources employee is doing 4 different tasks which are check for extra hours check leaving request check attendance system in order to know how many hours the employee worked and then check it with the system Unitime,Relevant
 Finally he checks sickness so if an employee was absent and then uses HR Accent in order to verify this,Relevant
When all these 4 steps are finally done he writes a recap  with all the information so he can export them to Securex,Relevant
Securex checks the feedback and sends it to the human resources,Relevant
After receiving the feedback from Securex the human resources employee treats the document in order to make a proposal for the salary,Relevant
After receiving the proposition there is a question within the HR are we agree with this proposition? If no the process restarted at the proposition of wage slip,Relevant
If the response is yes we can continue the process,Relevant
Human resources can then send the payment permission to Securex and wait until the reception of Securex agreement,Relevant
Subsequently several things have to be done at the same time we are going to describe them branch by branch,Irrelevant
Firstly in the first branch he receives the décompte de paye and then prints it in order to send the file to the employee,Relevant
Afterwards there is a question Is there any contestation? If there is no contestation we can continue and finalize the process with the acceptation of Securex payment,Relevant
But if there is a contestation we have to ask the CEO what to do with it and then a new process starts,Relevant
Finally on the other branch things that need to be done first are to ask Securex to prepare the invoice then we are waiting until Securex creates it and sends it,Relevant
After this there is another question Are we sending this to accounting or not? If the answer is yes we can accept Securex s payment and the process ends,Relevant
And if no once again we have to ask the CEO what to do,Relevant
This process starts when an application is sent by a candidate to the HR which do a first sorting and then a second one,Relevant
After this the first interview take place,Relevant
Then we are in the first question which is Is this a key position or not? If yes we need to know if we need complementary assessments if yes a specialist office makes a couple of tests and then sends the results to the HR,Relevant
After this we conclude whether it is okay or not,Relevant
If it is not we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that,Relevant
We therefore destroy these data,Relevant
But if it is okay we arrive to the second interview which is important,Relevant
If it is not necessary to get more assessments we can go directly to the second interview,Relevant
So at this moment we are at the same point,Irrelevant
After the interview there is a selection if the candidate is not selected then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
If it is not a key post we are directly in the step of selection,Relevant
So if the candidate is not selected then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
The process starts when the financial department picks up an invoice in order to pay it,Relevant
It should be noted that the file in question is recuperated in the ISABEL system,Relevant
Firstly the financial department employee prints the details of payment,Relevant
After this he shows the file to the financial director,Relevant
Afterwards he needs to classify the invoices according to whether they are above 150 000 euros or under 150 000 euros,Relevant
When we are under 150 000 the financial employee just has to inform the HR department,Relevant
When we are above 150 000 he has to ask the financial director to find out if it is okay,Relevant
After these steps we follow the same path in both cases and the process stays located in the financial and accounting department,Relevant
Then the employee verifies the liquidity on the account in order to know if there are no problems with the treasury,Relevant
After that he can send money to the bank account send an email to CBC bank with the details of payment and finally register the payment in the SAP system before ending with the receiving of the account statement,Relevant
This process starts when a client asks for an intervention,Relevant
This request is directly registered in a file,Relevant
Then it must be checked if the intervention is included in the contract,Relevant
If it is not the client must be asked whether he agrees with the financial part and then the client must respond to this in order for the organization to get his feedback If he doesn t agree the process stops,Relevant
But if he agrees the organization can define the costs of the intervention,Relevant
If yes the organization can define the costs,Relevant
After this at that moment we are on the same track it should be chosen if we need an internal quote or an external one,Relevant
We then arrive to 2 different questions The first one is Do we need an accord regarding the quote?  If the answer is yes the approbation of the client has to be asked,Relevant
If his answer is that it is okay he must be informed about the start of the intervention,Relevant
Then the intervention is finished,Relevant
But if he refuses the quote the process ends again,Relevant
If the answer is no the client must be informed about the start of the intervention and also when it will be finished,Relevant
The process starts when a customer makes a request to open close the P1 S1 port these are ports on the smart meter that allow the customer to connect their application on which they can consult their energy consumption in real time,Relevant
The call is received by an interlocutor called Connexio working for a defined network distribution manager in our case for ORES obviously,Relevant
The Connexio will then control whether the customer is addressing the correct DNM using an identification database,Relevant
If it is the wrong DNM the Connexio informs the customer and the call ends,Relevant
Once the DNM check has been carried out he will proceed to a process check,Relevant
If it is a High Voltage process the customer is redirected to another service otherwise if the process is Low Voltage the Connexio identifies the requester thanks to the database of municipalities and social housing then controls the verbal offer,Relevant
If it is not a verbal offer the request is transferred to the Connection Work process,Relevant
If it is a verbal offer the process continues and the Connexio controls the file,Relevant
If the file is existing he informs the client and the process ends otherwise he communicates the price of the service to the customer and reads the GDPR disclaimer in case of an opening then waits for the client s response,Relevant
If the client accepts a file is created,Relevant
Otherwise the file is immediately closed and the process ends,Relevant
After having created the file the Connexio asks if the client is able to receive a remote operation if he is not able he asks whether the preparatory work is the client s responsibility,Relevant
If he is able is the client s request unique? If the client s request is not unique he asks if the preparatory work is the client s responsibility otherwise he asks directly what type of appointment to make,Relevant
Concerning the preparatory work if they are not the client s responsibility then the Connexio asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
But if they are the responsibility of the customer the Connexio informs the customer about the preparatory work he waits for a response if the customer does not accept the file is closed and the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts then he also asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
There are two types of appointments The first one is if remote operations work from June 2020 the Connexio sends confirmation to the customer but also to the control room that the thing has been taken into account,Relevant
The control room receives this remote operation request for opening closing port P1 S1 and the process is terminated,Relevant
The second one is if the technician has to come to the customer s house the Connexio controls the duration of the intervention he schedules an appointment if the intervention cannot be scheduled the Connexio records the non schedulable intervention request and the call ends,Relevant
After scheduling the appointment he sends the appointment confirmation to the client waits for the appointment confirmation,Relevant
After receipt he sends the work order to the technician,Relevant
The technician receives the file and the process ends,Relevant
The process is separated in 2 lanes fieldworker and Work control OSP,Irrelevant
The process starts with the reception of a request to install a smart meter for the activation of prepayment mode,Relevant
All the processes arrive at the same gateway so I will describe each process up to the point of intersection and then explain what happens after,Relevant
1 The customer was present and another customer was present,Relevant
If the customer wants a recovery they process it to a recovery form,Relevant
If the customer doesn t want a recovery then they see if it is their first visit a 2 Another customer was not present and the customer accepts the installation,Relevant
bThey check the communication network coverage,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and they wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
c After that whether there is fraud or not if there is not a smart technical impossibility they replace the meter with a smart meter,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility they send the information of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put a budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna they move the antenna to another area covered by the network and follow c,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electromechanical technical possibility such as in c,Relevant
Another customer was not present and the customer does not accept the installation,Relevant
If the client is electro sensitive then the process goes directly to the checking of the electromechanics technical impossibility in the c,Relevant
If the client is not electro sensitive and it is their a first visit the process goes directly to the point of intersection,Relevant
If it is not their a first visit but it is their second visit and the meter installation is possible before shutdown then the process continues to point b,Relevant
If the meter installation is not possible before shutdown and a meter cut is possible 2 things happen simultaneously,Relevant
The first is checking if the meter installation is possible if yes it goes to b if not it goes to the point of intersection,Relevant
The second is to send the cutout start execution request to the meter and then wait for the message of the smart meter cut back,Relevant
If there is no cancellation request they perform the cut on the meter,Relevant
d After that an effective cutoff confirmation is filed which sends a message to the customer then they send the effective cutoff information which lead to the intersection point and e in the Work control OSP lane receiving information on the execution of cuts which send an end signal of management of cut returns,Relevant
f If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point,Relevant
If a meter cut is not possible g they check the possibility of a network cut,Relevant
If a network cut is possible they send the request to start the execution of the network cut then wait for the message to start network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process arrives at f and if not they execute the cut network then follow d,Relevant
If a network cut is not possible they send the non cut information which simultaneously lead the process to the intersection point and in h the work control OSP lane receive the information about non execution of cuts which send an end signal of post administration,Relevant
3 The customer was not present and it is the first visit,Relevant
If the meter is not accessible the process goes directly to the intersection point,Relevant
If the meter was accessible they check the communication network coverage,Relevant
i If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
j After that whether there is fraud or not if there is not a smart technical impossibility the meter is replaced with a smart meter and the process goes to the intersection,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility the information is sent of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put an electromechanics budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna the antenna is moved to another area covered by the network and follow j,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electrical technical possibility such as in j,Relevant
4 The customer was not present and it is not the first visit,Relevant
If it is their second visit and a meter installation is possible before shutdown they follow i,Relevant
If it is not their second visit or it is their second visit but the meter installation is not possible before shutdown they check if a network cut is possible,Relevant
If yes they send a request to start execution of the network cut and wait for a message of network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point and if not they cut the installation file an effective cutoff notice which sends a message to the customer and send confirmation of effective shutdown which leads the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane following e,Relevant
If the network cut is not possible the information is sent of the non execution of the cut which lead the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane following h,Relevant
All of these lead to one gateway after that they complete the worksheet,Relevant
If the client is present they sign the worksheet and if they are not a calling card is left for the customer which sends a message to them,Relevant
Both of them lead to saving the worksheet and ending the process in the Work control OSP lane with post administration,Relevant
This process is divided into 5 lanes planned works technical solution officer supervisor manager and CTM coordinator,Irrelevant
The process starts at planned works when an appointment s planning is needed,Relevant
First thing is to know if it is a grid construction work or not,Relevant
If it is not a grid construction work planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation they find out if there is an authorization or an information request a,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation is it an individual planning? b If it is a grid construction work that is needed the file is sent to the technical solution officer,Relevant
1 Planned works wait for the period defined in the order then check if there is a request for authorization or information,Relevant
a If it is an information request planned works show the levelling zone and encodings to Powalco and then check KLIM and CICC and the process goes on,Relevant
If it is an authorization request they check if the authorization has been received,Relevant
If it has been received the process goes on if it hasn t planned works contact the competent authorities again to receive the authorization then the process goes on,Relevant
Planned works then figure out if there s a presence of KLIM CICC,Relevant
If there is the file is sent to the CTM coordinator 2 and planned works wait for the CTM coordinator s feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received the process goes on,Relevant
* If there is not a presence of KLIM CICC planned works find out if it is an individual planning,Relevant
b If it is an individual planning the process goes on,Relevant
If it is not an individual planning they form the batches transmit a list to the contractor and inform the client and the process goes on,Relevant
c * Planned works then contact the client to arrange an appointment they make the client aware of the preparatory work and then plan the appointment with them,Relevant
They send a confirmation email to the client,Relevant
If the reply received is negative planned works contact the client again,Relevant
c If the reply is positive planned works assess if the work is planned on a contractor,Relevant
If it is planned works prepare the file that will be sent to the contractor and send it to him,Relevant
Then the process is done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work,Relevant
If it is not the file is sent to a technician and planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation the process is done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation planned works send the file to the contractor to carry out civil engineering,Relevant
The process is then done and a signal is sent to the process Execute the work,Relevant
1 When the technical solution officer gets the file they get back the file s investment cronos and check the CTM,Relevant
If there is a CTM file it is sent to the CTM coordinator 2 and the process goes on,Relevant
If there is not a CTM file the process goes on,Relevant
The technical solution officer adjusts the file d asks for authorization inform planned works of the theoretical period *,Relevant
The officer finally transfers the file to the supervisor and his part is over,Relevant
When the supervisor gets the file he checks if the authorization is received,Relevant
If it is not received the process goes back to the officer,Relevant
d If it is received the supervisor executes the construction work foresees the end of the work and informs the manager which gets the info then sends the file to the manager and the process is done,Relevant
The manager gets the file foresees the end of the work executes the operation work informs planned works of the end of the works * and then the operation work is done,Relevant
2 The CTM coordinator gets the file contacts the other recipients visits the work site creates a report and sends the feedback to planned works,Relevant
He then informs the technician and the contractor and the CTM is managed,Relevant
The two main ORES services involved in the work execution process are the planned works department and the executing agent working in parallel,Irrelevant
Three other ORES actors play a lighter role namely the  design office   supervision  and  local logistics manager ,Irrelevant
Executing agent The process starts with the receipt of the file,Relevant
Then either civil engineering works are required or not,Relevant
If they are required the agent plans them informs the planned works of the civil engineering opening date 1 then carries out the inventory of fixtures executes the earthworks and finally confirms the execution of the earthworks to the planned works 2,Relevant
Otherwise nothing happens,Relevant
After that the executing agent tries to reach the client 15 minutes before his departure and then goes to his home,Relevant
If the client can be reached and is present he carries out the inventory of fixtures,Relevant
If the client is not present at first the agent tries to reach him but if he is still unreachable the executing agent then leaves a calling card calls the BOPW encodes the mobile data and finally signs the report,Relevant
The Process ends in the management of the nonexecuted,Relevant
After the inventory of fixtures the agent checks whether additional work at the client s request is necessary if not he can directly check the certificate of conformity,Relevant
If any work is required the agent looks whether he needs BOPW information,Relevant
If so he will request it and wait for confirmation,Relevant
In case of refusal he checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
In case of confirmation or if BOPW information is not required he informs the customer of the costs asks for his agreement carries out the work and finally checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
After checking the certificate of conformity he checks the power and then jointly measures the column and replaces the meter and the parameter,Relevant
In the event of a problem at the time of replacement or parameter setting the agent informs the local logistics manager 3 if the problem concerns only one meter the operation is repeated otherwise an electromechanical meter is installed then the customer is informed and the agent answers any questions in the same way as if the parameter setting was carried out correctly,Relevant
After that if the LED confirms the functionality,Relevant
Then the meter is switched on otherwise it is left switched off,Relevant
Then he draws up an inspection plan which he sends to the Ores drawing office 4 enters the connection and counting data confirms the materials used draws up the output inventory and has the customer sign the report,Relevant
If civil works are required the agent plans the closure of the civil works informs the planned works of the closure date 5 plugs up the holes repairs in a definitive manner makes the inventory of fixtures and finally confirms the completion of the repair to the planned works 6,Relevant
Finally his last task is to encode the internal services in the case of internal services or to encode the internal services in the case of entrepreneurial work,Relevant
The process ends by sending the file to the post administration,Relevant
Planned work The process begins with the planning of the worksite,Relevant
Then if civil engineering works are required the planned works department receives the civil engineering opening date from the executing agent 1 the department then sends the civil engineering dates to the client waits and finally receives confirmation of the earthworks by the executing agent 2,Relevant
If no civil engineering works are required the planned works department informs the client by sms of the date of the works 48 hours in advance,Relevant
The department then receives the execution information,Relevant
If the execution is not carried out the process ends and the prepare for execution process begins,Relevant
If it has been carried out there is a waiting period,Relevant
Finally again if civil works are required the planned works department receives the civil works closing date from the executing agent 5 the department then sends the civil works closing dates to the client waits receives the confirmation of the civil works closing from the executing agent 6 and finally updates the data in the POWALCO software,Relevant
If there is no civil engineering nothing happens,Relevant
The process is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
The drawing office The process starts with the reception of the plan from the executing agent 4 and is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
Monitoring The process starts with the reception of the date of the works then the service ensures the supervision of the building sites and the process is finished with supervised building sites,Relevant
Local logistics manager The process starts with the reception of the message from the executing agent 3 then he processes the request and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts at planned works when a technical visit is needed,Relevant
If a visit without appointment V1 is needed planned works transfer the request to a technician and waits for feedback with the info concerning the V1,Relevant
While planned work is waiting a technician gets the request carries out the visit and transfers info to planned works before being done with V1,Relevant
When planned works get the V1 info they can move on and prepare a file for a technical visit V2,Relevant
If a V1 is not needed planned works directly prepare a file for a technical visit,Relevant
Planned works then plan V2 with the client,Relevant
After they send a request to agents to know their availability,Relevant
When the agents get the request they process it taking into account geographical and technical skills and send back their availabilities to planned works,Relevant
After receiving the agents  availability planned works confirm the appointment with the client and send the file to a technician,Relevant
They then wait for feedback while the technician gets the request carries out a technical visit and sends their feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received planned works handle it and then assess if civil engineering is required,Relevant
If it is not required the processing is done,Relevant
Otherwise the feedback is sent to the contractor and the processing is done,Relevant
The subscription process is facilitated by the digital transformation in usual context the customer and the company are engaged into an endless mail exchange demanding the documents for the subscription,Irrelevant
Thanks to Flora a new client only needs to enter some information about his property and his insurance fee is automatically calculated using the dimension and the location of his property,Relevant
If the new client is not in the defaulters  database there is no need for an employee to take part in the process the contract and insurance details will be automatically digitally created and sent to the customer,Relevant
If the client is indeed in the defaulter s database Flora needs to conduct a short investigation to determine if they accept the client or not before finishing the process following the classical way,Relevant
By using this process customers are now able to modify their contract online following a move for instance by simply entering details about their new property,Irrelevant
Their new price is calculated in the same way as in the subscription process and the rest is also similar contract and insurance details will be automatically created and sent to the customers as well as the new contract start date,Irrelevant
Flora allows the customer to make this report via a chatbox within the mobile app in a few steps,Irrelevant
Of course after the declaration an external contractor will come to your place to contact the damage but there is no need to extra paperwork that is usually used with the traditional way,Relevant
The following process is of high interest as switching insurance can be really difficult and require documents and long procedures from both the former and the new insurance company,Irrelevant
Noting that this is actually a sub process of the subscription as most new clients are often covered before subscribing to Flora,Irrelevant
To complete the process customers are invited to enter different information about their former contract such as the company and their contract number,Relevant
Then the resignation form is generated and signed online by clients using Itsme Belgian Mobile ID initiative,Relevant
The rest of the process is handled by Flora which will deal with the former insurer and will send them the resignation form,Relevant
Once these tasks are completed details about the former contract terms end date and the new contract start date are sent to customers,Relevant
At last the new contract will automatically start at the end of the former one,Relevant
By using Flora a procedure that can take several days for clients is now completed in a few minutes,Irrelevant
Filling a complaint is one of the most common processes inside an insurance company,Irrelevant
This is usually a very tedious process for the client but now thanks to the new channel of communication it is much easier for the clients using the Flora s application in order to fill a complaint this can be done in few minutes,Irrelevant
The prospection and commercial process is triggered by the sales engineers who study the requirements of the prospects potential clients,Relevant
Then the CEO COO elaborate sales strategy and set individual goals,Relevant
Sales Engineers receive requests for quotation from clients and afterwards they consider whether the project submitted by the customers is feasible for Alpha or not,Relevant
If not the request is declined and the process is stopped,Relevant
But if the quotation is feasible sales engineers work together with the help of R&D engineers to make a technical and commercial offer and ask for client s agreement,Relevant
If the customer s answer is not favorable then they try to know on which point they failed to interest the customer and then the process is stopped,Relevant
But conversely if the customer s response is favorable then back office registers new client and its order in the ERP system,Relevant
The sales engineers compare the order with the quotation made at the customer price quantity product description delay and after that a contract is written by the CEO in collaboration with the sales engineer with the possibility of having some negotiations with the customers on commercial terms,Relevant
If the order is compliant with the offer made the back office checks the availability of the product and the production delay announced by the ERP system,Relevant
Otherwise the continuity of the process goes back to the steps before there are once again negotiations with the customers in order to find a common agreement,Relevant
When these two tasks are completed the back office confirms and validates the order to the client and they register the complete order in the ERP system,Relevant
Once this last step is completed the prospection and commercial process ends,Relevant
The R&D process starts when a need is expressed,Relevant
Sales engineers and R&D engineers formalize the request describe the new product and evaluate the feasibility cost strategy coherence  in the early stages,Relevant
Then the CEO COO challenge their analyze and decide if the feasibility is conceivable the project is stopped if it is not the case,Relevant
Sales engineers and R&D engineers check prototype scale feasibility & conduct tests,Relevant
If the project is technically validated by R&D the production engineers go on by checking industrial feasibility and preparing production file,Relevant
After that step the Quality Manager certificates the product and requests client s approval by sending them the previous documents,Relevant
If the customer s feedback is good the bill of materials is made and the current process ends otherwise the engineers continue to improve the development plans and the process is repeated in the stages of carrying out tests and analyzing feasibility on a prototype scale,Relevant
The process starts when the engineers make the BOM Bill of Materials and send the file with the logistical needs defined by a color code,Relevant
Consequently a need is expressed and registered in the ERP system,Relevant
The supply chain department looks at the BOM and then decides if it needs comparative quotes,Relevant
If the purchase amount is estimated to be greater than 10000 comparative quotes are needed,Relevant
In this case the supply chain department searches suppliers consults three of them and compare their offers,Relevant
Then it chooses a supplier,Relevant
If the purchase amount is estimated to be less than 10000 the supply chain department does not need comparative quotes and directly selects a supplier,Relevant
After selecting a supplier there are two options If this is a new supplier the specific team composed by the COO the head of the supply chain department and the quality manager performs a supplier audit,Relevant
If the conclusions of this audit are not positive the supply chain department selects another supplier,Relevant
If the audit is conclusive the supply chain manager registers supplier s information in the ERP system and sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
If Alpha Innovations has already worked with this supplier the specific team sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
Afterwards the supply chain department establishes the order and receives the material once the supplier has fulfilled the order,Relevant
In some case a conformity certificate is required because AISA works with railway companies RATP for example or nuclear sector where high level of traceability is mandatory,Relevant
If a conformity certificate is required the supply chain department asks a conformity certificate to the supplier and creates its own conformity certificate this document ensures that the products are not counterfeit items before performing the quality control,Relevant
In some cases the supply chain organizes quality control for incoming and finished goods and the warehouse clerk checks it,Relevant
Alpha Innovations controls most of the time the products  quality except when it comes to checking small parts like basic screws etc,Relevant
If the quality control shows material is defective the supply chain gives the order to the warehouse clerk to return the product to the supplier,Relevant
If the quality control is good the warehouse clerk stores the product and registers it in the ERP system,Relevant
Finally the head of supply chain the quality manager and the COO evaluate the supplier s performance ask for corrective actions if the supplier is not performant enough and then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the workshop manager receives the project from the R&D department,Relevant
With the recommendations from the production engineer he evaluates which and how many workers must be assigned to this project linked to the difficulty s level of the latter,Relevant
With the help of the supply chain manager he checks when all the needed material BOM will be available in stock at the factory,Relevant
With all this information he gives an approximation of the delivery date to the customer,Relevant
He receives a set of documents thanks to the ERP system which describes the BOM Bill of Materials mechanical plans electrical scheme control prescription  everything that is needed to organize production of the project,Relevant
The supply chain department receives the document and launches a production order to the warehouse clerk who prepares and sends all the materials needed to the workshop,Relevant
At this stage the workshop manager must prepare assembly aid documents which describe the production process adapted to the type of work to be executed,Relevant
The function of the workshop manager is also to describe the jobs of each technician involved,Relevant
Afterwards technicians operate first they prepare nameplates to be able to identify all the products and cables,Relevant
Secondly they assembly the systems while they identify themselves at each step of the process for the tracing and consequently the responsibility,Relevant
The workshop manager is responsible for describing the complexity of conformity control which is afterwards operate by the technicians,Relevant
At this stage test technicians operate the FAI First Article Inspection they inspect the finished systems to see if it is safe functional and conform to the specifications,Relevant
If all tests are conclusive the system is sent to the shipment employee who will package and send it to customers with the help of other actors haulers ,Relevant
The systems production process ends at the moment the system is submitted to the shipment employee,Relevant
The process is triggered when the product is received by the packaging employee who packages the product,Relevant
Then two tasks are done in parallel addition of a suitable ID label to the package and wedging and wrapping to protect the product,Relevant
The packaging employee makes the delivery form and send it to the head of shipment department who is going to give a pick list number and afterwards registers the pick list number on the ERP system,Relevant
Later on the packaging employee fills the picklist with the product s information weight date  on the ERP system,Relevant
Subsequently the employee stores the product in the shipment area,Relevant
After that the head of shipment management received on the ERP system the picklist completed and then classify the picklist by due date until the delivery day,Relevant
When the delivery day has come the back office does two tasks at the same time to prepare the delivery note and print it and prepare the invoice and print it as well,Relevant
After that the back office sends the documents to all services concerned via the ERP system ie accounting,Relevant
Finally the packaging employee add the waybill and the delivery note on the package and thereafter he gives the package to the haulers,Relevant
The process ends when the order is sent,Relevant
The process starts when IT equipment is needed by a service manager,Relevant
The request is first analyzed by the head of the IT Department and they have to decide if the request is justified or not,Relevant
If the request is not justified the process ends,Relevant
If the request is justified they also have to decide if they accept it or not in some cases the request is justified but the solution requested to this need seems to be inappropriate,Relevant
If the request is not accepted but stays justified obviously the service manager has the opportunity to adapt the request and suggests a new request that the head of IT Department will analyze again and the process starts again,Relevant
The service manager has also the choice to not adapt his request and the process ends in this case,Relevant
But if the request is accepted then the head of IT department asks for a quote,Relevant
If it is the first time that the supplier works with the company the purchasing department has to add this supplier in the suppliers evaluation form,Relevant
If the budget or treasury will be affected with this expense the Chief Financial Officer has to analyze the expense and decides if he validates the expense or not,Relevant
If he does not validate it then the head of the IT Department has to ask for a new quote to a new supplier,Relevant
If the expense is validated the head of the IT Department completes the purchase form and then the purchasing department makes the order and sends it to the supplier,Relevant
When the order is ready the supplier sends it with the purchase documents that is to say the invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt to the head of the IT department who sends after all to the service manager,Relevant
Next both the head of the IT department and the purchasing department compare the purchase order with the delivery and the invoice,Relevant
If one of them finds something incorrect they contact the supplier in order to solve the problem and then compare it again and contact the supplier again until everything is in order,Relevant
When everything is correct or if everything was right the first time the Chief Financial Officer has to validate the purchase,Relevant
If he does not validate it the comparison process between the invoice the purchase order and the delivery starts again until the amount to be spent aligns with their expectations,Relevant
If he validates the purchase then he pays the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the need is notified by the receipt of a purchase order form by the service manager,Relevant
Then the purchase department has to analyse the demand if it is not ok the demand is obviously rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise they have to request a quote,Relevant
If the quote is asked to a new supplier the purchasing department has to add it into the evaluation suppliers form data base,Relevant
Then the financial management has to validate the quote if it is not ok the demand has to be analysed again but if it is financially ok the service can be ordered so the service department asks for an intervention,Relevant
The supplier performs the requested service and sends the purchase documents purchase order and invoice afterwards,Relevant
Next the purchasing department compares the purchase order with the invoice received and has to validate if something is wrong the invoice is not validated and the department contacts the supplier for another validation,Relevant
Otherwise the financial department has to validate it a second time,Relevant
Again if it is not ok the purchase department has to compare it again but if it is ok the financial department puts the invoice in payment and the process ends when the service provider is paid,Relevant
The process starts with the presentation of the candidate at the office,Relevant
He enrolls for the examination,Relevant
The centre manager checks the planning in the license database if the candidate is already planned,Relevant
If it is not the case the centre has to create a new file for this candidate in the license database,Relevant
Then he registers the candidate to the examination,Relevant
The applicant has to pay for his registration,Relevant
If the payment is not received the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues and the centre manager checks the validity of the candidate and guide s ID cards,Relevant
If those are invalid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If on the contrary the ID cards are acceptable the centre manager checks the age conditions,Relevant
If those are not fulfilled the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues and the centre checks that the ID card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If he notices a mismatch the Chief examiner seizes his ID card and warns the authorities,Relevant
The candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If it corresponds the centre checks the temporary driving license and the certificate from the municipality,Relevant
If those are invalid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If those are valid there are 2 possibilities,Relevant
Either the applicant has learned by a driving school or by another guide,Relevant
This second case requires an additional step the centre checks the guide driving license,Relevant
If his driving license is invalid the process ends and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If it is valid the process keeps going,Relevant
This step is not necessary if the candidate has learnt by a driving school,Relevant
Next the centre checks the vehicle documents,Relevant
If those are not valid the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the process continues with the examiner who checks the vehicle state,Relevant
If he evaluates the car as defective the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
On the contrary if the vehicle is in good conditions the centre manager makes a random selection of the examination track thanks to the IT system of the company and the candidate is allowed to take the examination,Relevant
The candidate is accepted and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the centre,Relevant
An employee of the centre completes the identity verification form at least every 25 candidates and checks the validity of the client s ID card according to the regulation,Relevant
If the ID card is not valid the process ends and the client is refused,Relevant
If it is valid the client s age is checked once again according to the legislation,Relevant
If the candidate doesn t fulfil the age requirement the process ends and he is refused,Relevant
In the case where the client fulfils the age requirement the centre employee checks that the card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If the card is not corresponding to the candidate the employee takes the ID card warns the authorities and the process ends,Relevant
The client is thus refused because of failure and fraud,Relevant
If the card corresponds to the candidate the centre employee checks the number of failures and the driving school certificate if necessary,Relevant
The employee then registers the candidate,Relevant
If a session is not available the client asks the availability and or takes an appointment then comes back to the beginning arrival,Relevant
If a session is available he checks that the client is already in the database,Relevant
If the client isn t the centre employee creates a new file in the Database Permis DB Permis ,Relevant
If the client was already registered or has just been registered the employee registers the candidates and checks his data,Relevant
After that the client has paid the employee generates a session for the candidate according to his category from the DB Permis  which generates a random series of questions,Relevant
The client takes the exam,Relevant
If a fraud is detected during the exam the centre interrupts the exam and warns the authorities the client is then refused failure and fraud and the process ends,Relevant
In each case the results are printed by the centre,Relevant
If the exam is passed the client takes the reading test and the process ends with the delivery of the provisional driving licence PCP the results and some information,Relevant
If the exam is failed the client is given the results of the exam,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the examination centre,Relevant
There is a previous control of the vehicle by the examinator before he makes a random selection for the track with the IT system,Relevant
Then he takes note of the track and manoeuvres,Relevant
The customer makes the track and manoeuvres directed by the examinator according to the traffic regulations,Relevant
The examinator assesses the abilities of the candidate,Relevant
If he makes a dangerous manoeuvre the exam is interrupted,Relevant
Otherwise the examinator makes a global assessment of the exam and he registers the assessments with the IT system,Relevant
He encodes the results and sends them to the server of the company with the IT system and the protocol of the exam,Relevant
Then he archives the protocol and at the same time he gives the result to the candidate,Relevant
If the result is a success the exam is passed but if it is a failure the exam is failed,Relevant
The first step in the registration process is the quote calculation,Irrelevant
It begins when someone needs to obtain a tenant insurance,Relevant
The user will then take an interest in Flora and go to the website,Relevant
The customer will go on découvrir mon prix and so the quote calculation process begins,Relevant
The user is now on the page where he selects the type of housing,Relevant
It can be a house 2 or 3 faces a villa 4 faces or a flat,Irrelevant
Selecting an accommodation type enables the user to move forward to the next screen,Relevant
The user just has to click on the right button to go further there is no continue button,Relevant
Then the user has to enter his address to go further in the process,Relevant
When the user starts typing his address a drop down list appears with all the street names corresponding to the entered characters,Relevant
In order to move forward the user has to select one address in the Google results and the system moves on directly to the next page,Relevant
If the user enters an address abroad the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora is only available in Belgium,Relevant
If the user lives in a zone subject to flooding a pop up window also appears to say that the house is located in a zone subject to flooding and that the user cannot be insured for the moment the user can be redirected to the Ethias website,Relevant
If the address is unknow the message Je ne trouve pas mon adresse appears,Relevant
The user is redirected to the page where he has to enter manually his address he has to complete manually all the fields,Relevant
If the address is known located in Belgium and complete the user clicks on Confirmer and is then redirected to the monthly rental amount page,Relevant
The monthly rental amount is a mandatory field,Irrelevant
If it is left empty a warning red notice must ask the user to correctly fill it out Max of characters 7,Relevant
If the user enters a higher rent the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora doesn t insure properties with a rent higher than 1500,Relevant
The user can decide to move on to the Ethias website or exit the Flora s quote calculation process by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner the button Je comprends,Relevant
The user then goes to the Prix page which mentions the price of the rental insurance for his property at his address,Relevant
The price covers the civil liability and the content of the housing,Irrelevant
The user can choose to add or not add the vandalism cover,Relevant
To finish this process the user has to tick the Checkbox of the terms conditions before being able to continue,Relevant
Once the quote calculation process is complete a customer profile must be created,Irrelevant
This process starts with the screen mon compte the user must fill in different information First name name date of birth phone number email address and password are mandatory fields,Relevant
Before going to the next step the system makes a verification about the age of the user,Relevant
In fact the user must be between eighteen and hundred years old because they consider that outside this age slice you are less likely to take out insurance,Irrelevant
So if the customer is under eighteen or over hundred the process stops and the customer gets stuck,Relevant
The next step consists in checking if the email address still exists in the system because it is possible to have a user who has given the account creation just after entering the personal information or who has left the process for a moment perhaps to pick up where he left off later on,Relevant
So if the email address did not still exist Flora will then send an email to the user in order to allow him to validate his email address,Relevant
In the email the user can push on a button Valider mon compte or on another Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora,Relevant
If the email address still existed we can go on the next step,Relevant
After that Flora has to check if the email address is still validated,Relevant
If it is the case the account is created and it s the final event,Relevant
If the user did not confirm his email address and pushed on button Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora the process stops and no account will be created for the user,Relevant
Just in order to precise a little at the end of this business process the user is still not a customer he is a prospect,Irrelevant
He will become a customer once he will be logged into the application as such,Irrelevant
This step of the process is important because it will be impossible for the user to use the app as long as he is not a real client,Irrelevant
Indeed he will be considered as a prospective customer until the moment he makes the payment,Irrelevant
Without this payment even if the user created an account he is not allowed to gain access to the application,Irrelevant
The first stage consists in asking the client information about his moving in the housing,Relevant
On the one hand if he already moved in Flora will invite the client to state if he is insured for this housing or not,Relevant
In case of a client who is already insured Flora will ask the user to enter the contact details of his previous insurer and we will deal with the termination of his contract,Relevant
On the other hand if the user has not moved in yet the app will request him to enter the date of moving in and his future address,Relevant
After that he will be invited to choose a payment method,Relevant
The client will soon be allowed to choose among three different means of payment with a credit card via PayPal or via Apple Pay,Relevant
For the moment there are only two payment methods available the credit card and PayPal,Irrelevant
By selecting the credit card as mean of payment the user will be redirected to the next screen,Relevant
At that point he will have to encode his card number the name of the card the validity date and the CVV number,Relevant
Obviously there will be no direct debit before the start of the contract,Irrelevant
In the case where the user would want to pay with PayPal he would be redirected to the PayPal interface in order to check that the available balance on PayPal is sufficient to pay,Relevant
Then the user can click on the button Suivant which will redirect him to another screen with a summary of his contract type of housing monthly rental amount full address contract duration price credit card registered and so on,Relevant
After having checked the elements of his contract he must accept the general terms conditions before subscribing to the product and paying,Relevant
Then he can click on Confirmer and in that case it means that the user wants to confirm and pay,Relevant
Once the contract is confirmed the client will be invited to download the application in order to handle his insurance directly from the application,Relevant
From the moment he confirmed the contract is forward to him by email,Relevant
Finally at this step of the process the client receives a confirmation email with the documents related to the contract attached,Relevant
If he receives this email it means that the payment is accepted and therefore the contract is confirmed,Relevant
From a legal point of view it is mandatory to send a confirmation email to the policyholder,Irrelevant
From that moment the client can log in into his account access his profile and his documents ask questions manage decisions and request a refund in the event of a damage,Irrelevant
First of all when the client wants to create a new claim he needs to open the chat bot in the app,Relevant
The date of the damage will be requested from the customer to verify if he was covered by insurance at the time of the damage,Relevant
If this is not the case the client will not be compensated,Relevant
Then the client will receive a reduced list of the frequent damage and will be asked to select the damage concerned,Relevant
If the damage is not in this list then it may be part of the list of damages not covered and in this case the customer will not be compensated,Relevant
Or the client may request to be put in contact with the CCM customer communication management,Relevant
However if the damage has been found on the list the process continues normally,Relevant
The client will then be asked whether or not it was a personal property,Relevant
If it is then the client will give more information about the asset,Relevant
And if it is not the process continues to the next step,Relevant
In that step the client will have the opportunity to report another claim if this is the case the client will be sent back to the beginning of the process in order to give all the necessary information again,Relevant
If there is no further damage to report then the customer will be asked for the owner s contact information,Relevant
Afterwards the application will ask the customer if there is at least one property that belongs to the owner,Relevant
In both cases a summary adapted to the situation will be sent to the customer,Relevant
Finally if the customer wishes to conclude and send the notification of the damages he will have to click on Envoyer the damage will be transferred and the case will be finished,Relevant
Once the damage has been notified and that the claim has been transferred to Ma demande it will be transferred to the customer manager,Relevant
He will then process the claim starting by judging whether or not it is important,Relevant
If the claim is significant he will call in an expert to determine the amount of compensation,Relevant
Otherwise he will define the amount himself on the basis of the information provided by the customer in the Flora application,Relevant
It is possible that the customer manager may not have the necessary information to calculate the refund,Relevant
In this case he will send an e mail to the customer to request the missing information,Relevant
Once the amount of compensation has been determined the customer manager will enter it into the application,Relevant
Then if this amount is higher than 1000 euro the Flora application must approve the compensation request before sending it to the customer,Relevant
If Flora detects a flaw it will inform the customer manager who will re analyse the situation,Relevant
Otherwise if Flora approves the request for compensation or in the event that the amount is less than 100 euro the compensation proposal will be sent to the customer,Relevant
The next step depends on the client s approval of the compensation proposal,Irrelevant
If the customer approves Flora will ask for the customer s bank account number and an electronic signature via ITSME,Relevant
Once the compensation proposal has been signed the client will be reimbursed and will receive a notification that the file has been closed,Relevant
The client receives the compensation amount on his bank account and the process is thus completed,Relevant
If on the other hand the customer does not approve the compensation proposal Flora will forward this refusal to the customer manager,Relevant
The acquisition of lands and buildings process by Spi follows a certain chain of events decisions and actions,Irrelevant
First of all they start by asking the government procurement if there is any land or buildings available,Relevant
In order to do this they send a letter expressing their wish,Relevant
If there are no lands or buildings available they express to the government procurement that they are aiming to buy so they fill in a form to be added to the waiting list and they will be notified when an opportunity comes along,Relevant
If something is available the procedure usually begins with an estimation of the property solicited by the government procurement,Relevant
Then this estimation is reported to Spi,Relevant
Since Spi is aiming to rent or sell these acquisitions before they buy lands and buildings they need to be sure that they will bring interests to their clients,Relevant
So they decide to carry out a market research and see if the assets are interesting enough,Relevant
If it is not interesting they decide to drop off,Relevant
If it is interesting then Spi asks their experts to carry out their own estimation of the asset,Relevant
If the estimation matches they carry out the next step otherwise the company and the government procurement try to reach an agreement,Relevant
Without any agreement found the company can decide to end the acquisition process,Relevant
After they agree on a price Spi asks the bank if they are allowed to have a loan,Relevant
To do so the financial department provides the bank with the expertise and the result of the market research,Relevant
Then they have to wait 10 days to have a decision from the banker,Relevant
If after 10 days they don t have an answer they can reschedule an appointment to have the final decision usually if they don t have an answer after 10 days it s because the loan has been rejected so during this second meeting they will try to find a new arrangement,Relevant
If no arrangement has been found the process ends here,Relevant
The commercialization of plots of lands and building starts when Spi receives by email the interest of a client to buy a building or a plot of land,Relevant
Then it has to acknowledge confirm the receipt in order to follow the sale,Relevant
Once the receipt acknowledges Spi has a free two month reservation to send a form to the candidate buyer,Relevant
This one fills out the request and sends it back to the company which has the duty to complete sign and date the form,Relevant
Once this first step done Spi  executive board has one month to take a decision about the sale of its plots of land or building,Relevant
The agreement between these two parts remain valid for a period of six months,Relevant
Then the company gives an agreement in principle to formalize the contract and the sales otherwise if the candidate buyer doesn t respect this six month validity Spi cancels the contract and the client is obliged to give 10 of the sum of the land or the building to the company eg when the client doesn t want to buy the land anymore before the 6 months,Relevant
When the six months are respected Spi will receive the 10 of the value of the land by the candidate buyer and it has to sign the deed,Relevant
Later Spi checks if the payment is correct and if the reservation fee has been paid in one month,Relevant
Then if all is done in the rules Spi orders the measuring plan and the placement of markers on the sold property,Relevant
The reception of the proof credit from a bank by Spi leads to the selling of the land,Relevant
Otherwise if the reservation fee is not received in one month the order is rejected,Relevant
The Head of the rental department receives a request concerning the rental of a building,Relevant
He sends the request to the legal department they check whether the request is complete and legal,Relevant
If the document is not complete the client gets a message saying that he has to complete his documents,Relevant
If the document is complete the head of the rental department schedules a meeting with the client,Relevant
During this meeting the client proposes a price,Relevant
If the price is too low the head of the department does a counterproposal which is then accepted or not by the client,Relevant
When the client refuses the negotiations are over and we consider the process done,Relevant
When a correct deal has been reached by the 2 parties we draft a contract,Relevant
When the contract is signed the process has reached its end,Relevant
The appeal for intervention process in which the trigger event is the need for services such as reparations gardening  Once the problem is identified the maintenance department looks for companies with qualified people who could fill this need and then get in touch with that company,Relevant
They explain the need or issue,Relevant
If this person is indeed qualified for this request a quote is asked,Relevant
When the quote from the company is received the maintenance department examines it,Relevant
If it seems correct they send it to the financial department which determines if it fits the company s budget in order to submit their agreement or not,Relevant
If they do agree the maintenance department contacts the company again to complete the final terms and sign a contract,Relevant
Otherwise they explain to the company that they do not want to go any further and restart the search for qualified people,Relevant
Once both parties have signed the contract the financial department proceeds with the payment,Relevant
Finally the maintenance department checks the service delivery to be sure that it is well done and that it meets their expectations,Relevant
The data analysis process is done in several steps First data analysts collect data from different sources for every sector,Relevant
Then they merge the data from different sources and make a relation between them unnecessary data is cleaned in order to concentrate on the economic analysis,Relevant
Data analysts analyze the evolution of the annual revenue of the companies for each sector and they combine the data of SPI with the one coming from the outside sources,Relevant
Finally the results are interpreted and the analysts make the best economic analysis possible and come to a conclusion,Relevant
The report of the analysis is then published in the database of the company so that it is accessible to everyone,Relevant
Everything starts when a student is positive for the COVID 19,Relevant
The school will receive the information via email phone or even via SMS,Relevant
Whether it s via phone the school management will ask some specific questions such as what was the last day in class when did the student do the test when did the student receive the results and so on,Relevant
Then they will fulfil the file with their own information such as the place where the student is sitting in class the schedule from each class  To do so they must dispose of the class plans,Relevant
Moreover it should be done regarding one clear and precise model,Irrelevant
Once the file is completed they can start analysing the information,Relevant
The first and the most important one is to know who the students with high risks are,Relevant
For that they will consult the class plans and will make groups of students those who are behind the positive student are not impacted nevertheless those who are on both sides from this student are risky only if they have had close contact with the positive student without masks,Relevant
Unfortunately this operation is hard because of option courses,Irrelevant
Indeed there are a lot of different class plans for these courses meaning that students are not always sitting next to the same students depending on the courses,Irrelevant
Once every single information has been collected they will send the complete file to the Safety Advisor via email,Relevant
When she receives the email she will make a first analysis then she will either transfer the file to the PSE the School Medicine or just will share the information that there is one more positive student in the school in order to receive a solution to implement,Relevant
However if it is an urgent situation the school management will take the decision to close a class without consulting the PSE,Relevant
In the normal process the PSE will analyse the sent file and will send instructions to the Safety Advisor who will send them to the school management,Relevant
On the one hand students with high risks will receive a mail with the procedure to apply and a coming back date,Relevant
On the other hand students with no risks will receive a small mail to be aware of the positive student,Relevant
If it is possible one or two members of the school management will go to the concerned class to give some extra information about the s positive student and answer some questions,Relevant
If the class is closed the school management will send another email to specify it,Relevant
Then they will phone each parent,Relevant
After that each excluded student will receive work on the LMS platform and thereby a coming back date,Relevant
The process begins when a teacher is absent,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for more than 3 months at least 15 weeks then they have to hire a priority temporary that is a teacher who has already given lessons either in the school or in a group of schools attached to the school for at least 360 days accumulated not necessarily in the same school,Relevant
In this case the management looks in its database for a priority temporary,Relevant
If there is a priority temporary in the database they contact him her by phone,Relevant
Finally a management member sends the schedule of the teacher to be replaced to the substitute teacher and the teacher is replaced,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for less than a day then he is not replaced,Relevant
However if he she is absent for more than a day then a substitute teacher must be found,Relevant
To find a substitute teacher there are two possible ways either the candidate has sent his her CV printed and classified in a folder in order of importance of the title or via the website Primoweb on which we will be able to go do a search according to the teacher you want to hire,Relevant
Management will be able to enter a series of criteria such as the duration of the exercise the branch of expertise and so on,Relevant
Then after pushing on the search button they can see the number of titles required of sufficient titles and of shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of application by CV the candidate selection sub process begins when the file containing the applications is opened If there are required titles available then these are directly selected,Relevant
Otherwise we go to sufficient titles,Relevant
If there is no sufficient title we move on to shortage titles,Relevant
If there is no shortage title we move on to unlisted shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of a candidate who has none of these titles it would be considered an error in the system and the process would end,Relevant
Then the CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
In the case of Primoweb we will first choose the required titles then the sufficient titles and then the shortage titles the unlisted shortage titles are not listed on Primoweb,Relevant
Then we send an email to the candidate,Relevant
If he she accepts his CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
If he she refuses then the management goes back to Primoweb and looks for another replacement again in order of degree of importance,Relevant
If he she does not respond within 3 days the management returns to Primoweb and searches for another replacement always in order of degree of importance,Relevant
This process can sometimes take a very long time,Irrelevant
After downloading the candidate s CV the members of the management will judge whether it is interesting or not,Relevant
If it s not interesting that ends the process and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If the CV is interesting we are faced with 2 situations,Relevant
If the situation is urgent for example when a teacher falls ill then the substitute teacher is directly contacted by telephone to replace the absent teacher,Relevant
If the situation is not urgent or at least foreseeable for example in the case of a work stoppage related to pregnancy then they will send an email to the candidate to prepare an interview,Relevant
The management team will then do the interview,Relevant
If the interview is successful a member of the management phones the candidate to confirm the replacement of the teacher,Relevant
If the interview is not good the candidate is rejected,Relevant
After calling the candidate they usually send the schedule of the teacher to be replaced,Relevant
The process starts when the teacher wants to do an excursion with his students,Relevant
Once the teacher has found an excursion he she has to download an excursion document located on the digital workspace of the school in order to complete the first point of the document,Relevant
Then he she has to send that document to the school management where they will check for the validity of the document,Relevant
If the document is not valid the process comes to an end and the excursion will not take place,Relevant
If the document is valid the school management has to decide if they want to let the teacher carry out the excursion or not,Relevant
If they decide to not give the permission to execute the excursion the process comes to an end,Relevant
If they decide to let the teacher do the excursion they have to sign the document and send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then evaluate the price of the excursion and he she will inform the teacher,Relevant
The teacher will then inform the parents of the excursion and give them all the necessary information such as the location the price the date and some general information about it,Relevant
After that the teacher has to wait for the parents  decision to either let go or not their child on the excursion,Relevant
Once the teacher has received the parents  decision he she will book the excursion and carry it out,Relevant
Once the excursion is done the teacher has to complete the rest of the excursion document and to send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then complete the document with other necessary documents such as the invoice and he she will also mention the fees of the excursion in the periodic settlement of the students so that the fees will be added to what the parents have to pay at the end of the period,Relevant
After that the document is archived and the process is completed,Relevant
Because of the covid crisis Sainte Véronique had to modify their organisation of parents  meeting process,Irrelevant
Indeed parents cannot enter the school anymore,Irrelevant
The school tried the new process out in June last year and they improved it for this year,Irrelevant
The process starts when report cards are encoded in the specific software used by the school,Relevant
The student s report is then received by his or her parents,Relevant
In the report card there is a comment section in which parents can find the teachers the school wants them to meet,Irrelevant
An online form is created on the LMS and sent to the parents for each year,Relevant
The questions are the following first name and last name of the student class name of the person filling the form phone number of this person a multiple choice question with three time intervals and who are the three teachers the parents want to meet,Irrelevant
Once the due date to fill in the form is reached the form is closed by the IT manager,Relevant
The form is exported in an Excel format and the table is shared with the teachers on the LMS,Relevant
The table is posted on the right year group,Relevant
Teachers can download the document and check whether the parents who were asked to meet them are on the list,Relevant
If they are not on the list the teacher has to add them,Relevant
Once it is done the teacher can schedule the phone calls,Relevant
If needed the school can provide some phones and a room for teachers to call the parents,Relevant
If during the parents  meeting the teachers notices an exceptional situation he or she has to notify the school management,Relevant
The school management will then handle the case depending on the situation,Relevant
Every new year Collège Sainte Véronique opens its enrolment process which consists of registering first year students for the following academic year,Relevant
Before entering the heart of the process the school has to achieve some optional or mandatory activities in order to prepare the enrolment period,Relevant
The mandatory one is to communicate the school capacity for first year students as well as the number of classes in the different sections general path immersion path,Relevant
For the optional ones on the one hand they have the possibility to enter into partnerships with other institutions to facilitate the movement of students from one school to another,Relevant
On the other hand a first contact may be organized,Relevant
Then from February 10 th the first enrollment phase starts and pupils can hand over their application form to the school,Relevant
Of course the school must check if the application form is correct and well filled,Relevant
If it is not the case the application is refused and cancelled,Relevant
Next we need to distinguish the first and the second enrolment phase because applications will not be handled in the same way,Relevant
Registration requests must therefore be allocated to the period corresponding to them,Relevant
The first phase begins on February 10 and ends on March 7 while the second phase is opened from April 27 to August 24,Relevant
First registration phase Each application for registration must first be registered and then updated in the register which in most cases takes the form of a database,Relevant
In each application form there are two sections that have to be completed by parents,Irrelevant
The general part has to be hand written but for the confidential part parents have the choice to fill it online or in paper format,Relevant
If the parents choose the paper format the school is responsible for mailing the confidential section to CIRI,Relevant
Otherwise with the online form the form is directly transmitted to CIRI,Relevant
Finally the school sends a confirmation mail to say that the application has been handled correctly,Relevant
Once March 7 is reached the school closes the first registration phase,Relevant
If there are more registrations than available places pupils will be ranked according to different criteria by CIRI,Relevant
The ranking is used to attribute places to top ranked pupils,Relevant
The ranking and the result of the selection has to be sent to the pupil and parents,Relevant
If the pupil has been selected a registration certificate is created,Relevant
Else the pupil is put on the waiting list,Relevant
If there were not more registrations than available places a registration certificate is immediately created,Relevant
Second registration phase As for the first phase the school has to register each application and update the register book,Relevant
However it is not necessary to send the confidential section to CIRI because this part is used to make the ranking,Relevant
After that either the school is already complete and the pupil has to be put on the waiting list or there are still places left and a registration certificate can be immediately created for the pupil,Relevant
A student in phase 2 will not be given priority over a student in phase 1 in the waiting list,Relevant
From now the two phases can be gathered in one common path,Relevant
On the side of students who received a certificate of registration the school has to request that the pupil provides his CEB,Relevant
If the CEB is received before September 1 the process carries on,Relevant
Else the application will be rejected and a certified refusal letter with return receipt requested will be sent,Relevant
Then at the start of the school year attendance will be taken and if the pupil is not present he will have to justify his non attendance within 8 days otherwise he will be expelled,Relevant
On the side of students who are on the waiting list they have to wait until a place becomes available,Relevant
If it is the case the school will inform the pupil of the situation and will ask him whether he wants to take the place or not,Relevant
If so then a registration certificate will be written and the process will follow the normal path described earlier,Relevant
If the student refuses the place then his application will be cancelled,Relevant
A student on the waiting list can also cancel his or her application by sending a message to the school,Relevant
And lastly the waiting list is closed on August 24 which means that all students still on it will receive a certificate of refusal,Relevant
The recruitment is dealt with by the administrator Pierre Girretz himself,Irrelevant
Indeed as mentioned before the company does not have an HR department nor a true recruitment system established since the administrator can easily do this type of work himself,Irrelevant
This process is triggered only when a new post is available and it is done in a more or less informal but also classical way he receives applications and reads the CVs then Mr,Relevant
Girretz first checks if the applicant has the competencies required for the job degree experience ,Relevant
If the resume does not correspond to what is expected then the application is rejected by email with a thank you for sending the CV,Relevant
If the candidate seems to have the right competencies on paper then he receives a notification to fix a date for an interview,Relevant
Right after the interview the administrator evaluates the candidate on his personality,Relevant
Indeed Mr Girretz puts a lot of importance on his gut feeling,Irrelevant
So if the personality matches then the candidate is given a trial period to see the quality of his work see if he can work with the team and to check if the person understands what the company needs and if he will be involved in the future,Relevant
If the candidate does not fulfill these characteristics then his application is rejected after the trial period,Relevant
Otherwise if the administrator is happy with his work he scans the person s ID and bank cards and they both sign the hiring document given by Securex and finally the applicant is officially hired after declaring the recruitment to the Dimona,Relevant
This process consists of the reception of the different supplies needed to build the pellet stoves,Irrelevant
First the supplier receives a notification with the item Sûti needs then they prepare the order and notifies the company when it is ready to be sent,Relevant
When the items are received the head of the production checks their quality by following the production quality sheet s instructions and ticks the boxes corresponding,Relevant
If their quality is ok then the item s QR codes are scanned to be registered on the system and then each item is placed at the post where it will be needed to build the stoves,Relevant
In other words the head of the production paves the way for the order preparation process,Irrelevant
However if the items are defective then a letter is written to explain the problem to the supplier and the supplies are sent back to receive better ones,Relevant
When a client wants to buy a stove he needs to request a quote on Sûti s website and to choose from a list of characteristics his dream pellet stove,Relevant
Then when the company receives it assuming every item is in stock the order preparation process can begin,Relevant
Employees working in the production line start by identifying the type of stove the client wishes to order they write down the model the power of the stove optional features  and they also transfer the quote to the reseller since he will be the one in charge of providing the final product to the customer,Relevant
After that the production line checks if the items needed for assembly are in stock,Relevant
If not an order request is sent to the supplier to receive the missing supplies,Relevant
When every item is in stock employees search for pieces  emplacement in the system thanks to the QR code they scanned when they first received the items,Relevant
Then the actual assembly can start the goods go from post to post the stove is built little by little at every step,Relevant
Once it reaches post number N the number of posts depending on each case the final product is fully built and is ready to go through a quality check,Relevant
Once this quality check process is done the pellet stove is packaged in a plastic cover and a wood box,Relevant
Finally it can be shipped to the reseller store which will be in charge of selling the stove to the customer,Relevant
This process is basically about testing the stove from A to Z looking for leaks checking for malfunctions and so on,Irrelevant
The quality check is once again done in the production line,Irrelevant
The process starts when a stove is done being assembled and ends when it is operational and can be sent to the reseller,Relevant
In the first step the employees fill in the production quality sheet by first writing down the stove s info like the guaranteed number the model its options the customer s details and so on,Relevant
Next the stove s components are checked and tested by following the sheet s instructions,Relevant
They then turn the engine on to check it works perfectly and that there is no leak or any other problem as said previously,Relevant
If there is an issue then workers use the QR code system we talked about earlier to find which pieces are missing or misplaced in the stove and fix them,Relevant
When they are sure the stove is working well they can start to suck potential dirt and clean the whole stove,Relevant
Once both are done they stick an A++ label and a CE European Conformity label on the door of the engine,Relevant
After that the rest of the quality sheet has to be filled up,Relevant
Then an instruction sheet a plan of the stove and a list of the items are added to the packaging of the pellet stove,Relevant
In the end the product is fully operational and is ready to leave the company,Relevant
The after sales process begins when a client needs professional intervention,Relevant
When the client wishes to do its stove s annual maintenance a qualified operator is sent to its home,Relevant
In that case it is not Sûti who is responsible for that operation but the stoves reseller store depending on the localization stores in Belgium France Switzerland ,Relevant
So Sûti s employees will not take care of the maintenance but rather an external professional who has conducted one of Sûti s training or a mechanic who has Sûti s approval to operate on its stoves will do it,Relevant
If the client needs an intervention because its stove has a technical problem then it contacts Sûti,Relevant
The administrator the chief technician and the head of the production can all take care of the process indifferently,Irrelevant
When the company is notified it then fills in the after sales form by between others selecting the stove type and its features the MAC & IP addresses of the stove the type of service it needs and by writing the customer s and the reseller s contact information,Relevant
If the stove needs a physical intervention because it cannot be dealt with remotely then the problem is handed over to MILLE Services a subsidiary company,Relevant
After receiving information on the problem this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove then the after sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant
Otherwise if physical intervention is not necessary which is mostly the case then Sûti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant
So first they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove then they will change the engine s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant
When they are done they check if the stove is operational,Relevant
If so the after sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant
If not then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically thus Sûti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
When the welder load is planned he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant
First of all the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant
After that several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant
On the one hand the quality manager will design the quality plan,Relevant
On the other hand the design engineer will first analyze the file in order to be able to draw the nomenclature of the project,Relevant
After that the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task executed by the design engineer,Relevant
When all the questions will be covered it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant
Now it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant
If the customer has other questions he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
If the customer approves the drawing the company will receive an email from him,Relevant
After having received the customer approbation the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
After that the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant
The plan as built will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
It is important to know that Into this process each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
Then they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant
In fact they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant
If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant
Once this is done we can send the request for a quote,Relevant
When the purchasing department receives the quote it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Once the order is received by the storekeeper he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant
If a control card exists then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
If the order is non compliant then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non compliance,Relevant
Once this is completed the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant
At another time the billing department will receive the invoice of the order which will start their process,Relevant
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant
The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources internal or external audit report management review customer complaint non compliance suggestion etc,Relevant
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager QAM,Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
It is important to detect the issue which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the QAM,Relevant
Then the QAM will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
When the amelioration file is finished the QAM will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant
If there is no improvement needed the QAM will answer to the improvement demand applicant with if possible an explanation for the refusal,Relevant
However if an improvement is needed the QAM will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined the QAM will inform the direction,Relevant
When the direction is informed of the issue she provides the necessary means and then launches the action,Relevant
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
In parallel the QAM follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant
When the improvement action is finished the QAM checks the effectiveness of the action implemented ie checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant
If the result is satisfying the improvement action process ends there,Relevant
Otherwise the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met ,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at no significant cost is not possible,Irrelevant
Immediate repair at low cost is possible but the problem is recurrent,Irrelevant
Immediate low cost repair is possible but can lead to an opportunity for improvement,Irrelevant
Supplier defect which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors,Irrelevant
Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a complaint sheet is completed and if necessary a non conformity sheet is completed,Irrelevant
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non conformity,Relevant
Next they have to fill in the non conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM Project manager,Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
If the answer is no the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant
If it is approved the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant
If the client doesn t accept it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
He will close the NCS remove the marking non conformity and notify the QAM who shall verify the process make analysis,Relevant
After the analysis if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken they will make a new one,Relevant
If not they will archive the non conformity,Relevant
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client s equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
The project manager asks the management for an approval and depending what the management will decide the client s request will be approved or not,Relevant
If the request is rejected the project manager will send a rejection to the client otherwise the process continues and the project s file is created with an ERP s number,Relevant
Then the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Finally with all the information received the project manager makes the quote and then asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant
Afterward the project manager establishes the offer which is registered in the ERP and sends it to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer the project manager receives the order form,Relevant
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
The contract is reviewed by the project manager the file is prepared and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation registration process is ended,Relevant
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
Indeed they have to write several articles for the next day s daily journal,Irrelevant
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received for example through the alert us button of their website,Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
Therefore if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant
Once the subject is received or chosen the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant
We will consider Liège s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Liège s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
However if the information comes from the alert us button the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant
A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant
If a journalist were to obtain crucial information it must be published even partially as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant
Thus it is directly posted on Sudpresse s paying website,Relevant
On the contrary if the information can wait the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant
Once it is done the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point to know what he should search next,Relevant
In both cases phone calls emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
Sometimes as demonstrated in the previous process information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant
That is why the information written as quickly as possible will be briefly explained on Sudpresse s paying website,Irrelevant
Following this event a strategic marketing employee in the newsroom creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant
This teasing includes a link to the company s paying website,Irrelevant
Afterwards the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website adding information and upgrading the layout until it is complete and perfect,Relevant
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
If he gets new information from a tier he contacts this tier that becomes thus one of a source or any other source who can verify clarify this new information,Relevant
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
Compared to a few years ago journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
Then once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites and when due to the tight timing the article must be finished to be in the next day s newspaper the journalist asks for a page of the next day s daily journal and starts copying the article s content,Relevant
Before every publication digital or paper the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant
Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant
First relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant
Then these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant
Once this step is operated the rotary press is switched on,Relevant
Then plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers  pages are printed,Relevant
At this stage a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
During the whole work of the machine printing assembling  the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
First we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant
Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01 00 am they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
Once the newspapers are in those centers vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
This must take place before 7 30am as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries 7am at the latest as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
Through this process description we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant
Nowadays writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant
Therefore various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant
Nevertheless thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant
We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website which format which size which colors which position on the page etc,Relevant
The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly these people s background and profile by using big data,Relevant
Once the advertising spots have been defined it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant
Using the data previously collected sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
On the newspaper they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page half a page or an entire page knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant
In this case advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company ending with a link to the company s website,Relevant
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
An advertisement may appear one or multiple times depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant
Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant
When it is done the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
If it is not the contract is reviewed,Relevant
A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a Poivre&Sel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer s usual point of sale,Relevant
If the client doesn t call his her usual point of sale the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant
If the client is a new or a usual one 10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant
Afterwards he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant
If none of the employees is available the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise the employee answering the call determines the type category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant
It is then the job of the franchisor CEO to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
If information is missing he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of Poivre&Sel Teamleader,Relevant
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
When the payment is completed the employees can start the order,Relevant
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
After this discussion he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
If he decides to continue then Mr Buche will take him on a day long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant
After that day both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
If they continue the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant
Once this is done the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant
Once he has found it he will show it to Mr Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant
If it is not the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant
If it is the calculations are sent to the franchisee s accountant for validation,Relevant
Once validated it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
Then we see if the idea is appreciated if not we stop,Relevant
If it is appreciated the franchisee who had the idea suggests to make a vote,Relevant
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
If the majority raises their hands we make the recipe if not the requested is rejected,Relevant
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at Poivre&Sel to eat,Relevant
First of all the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant
If the customer eats on the spot the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant
Once the order is taken the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
Then the waiter waits until the customer s meal is over ie when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
If the customer has taken out the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
If a product is missing from Poivre&Sel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available the office manager checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant
If the product is available we ask for the quantity of this product x at Poivre&Sel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at Poivre&Sel,Relevant
If the product is no longer available the supplier asks for salt and pepper if he wants to order if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information invoice delivery date by e mail,Relevant
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
He goes to the line manager who welcomes him then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant
Later the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant
He begins his training and medical supervision and the process is over for him,Relevant
If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months it is considered as a first contract,Relevant
Therefore the worker is registered at the guard post then he is greeted by the head of the department who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant
Later the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant
If an IT account must be created the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant
If not the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
Then an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator his release date is encoded on HR Access the human resources management software package,Relevant
The C4 the unemployment certificate and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
After that the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant
Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses  managers before 10 am to conclude it,Relevant
Later he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank s website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
Finally the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
if the manager has received the evaluations he must review them otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant
If the assessment is understandable the plant HR director if we need training if so we set up training and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant
If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre software then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
If the candidates respond to the applications of the function they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant
If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
First of all the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside supermarkets small shops ,Relevant
Then Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant
If it does not have them it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant
The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant
Once the products are available the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant
As far as the recruitment process is concerned it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant
For operators Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2 sometimes 3 interviews with the applicant,Relevant
The first one is with the direct manager ie the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company s managers,Relevant
Following this second interview they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
About 50 people are employed in production and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant
Goumanisto s objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
Finally the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes both operations are still done manually,Relevant
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
Indeed the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant
R&D is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
Then they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently they are validated by the R&D department and presented to the general council,Relevant
On the other hand if they could not be profitable everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
Then he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency s database,Relevant
If a matching profile has been found the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If he has not been employed the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant
If one is found the loop is going again,Relevant
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
Indeed when the client wants a very specific candidate the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant
When the job does not require any specific skills the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant
Whether it would be a specific or a non specific job when a candidate respondsto the announcement the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed the process ends,Relevant
If the candidate has not been employed the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant
However if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant
Indeed the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap the client has to warn Asap,Relevant
So when Asap receives a message from the client the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
After the phone call the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
If so the process ends,Relevant
If a meeting has been agreed the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant
On the convenued day the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
So the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant
Before discussing specific topics of the job he has to check the candidate references,Relevant
After the discussion the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
After the meeting the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency there are two possibilities,Relevant
On one hand if the feedback is bad the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant
In this case the process ends,Relevant
On the other hand if the feedback is good the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant
After sending the message the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
In this case the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant
When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client the process can start,Relevant
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
When the bank receives the message from ASAP she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate s bank account,Relevant
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
If it is the case the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant
On the side of the agency if she doesn t receive a message from the candidate the process is fulfilled but when a payment error message is received the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant
When the candidate has not been paid enough the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If the candidate has been too much paid the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant
So the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant
We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
After the phone call the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant
On the said date the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant
So the superior can start the meeting,Relevant
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
Then he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant
After that the superior can end the meeting,Relevant
When the meeting is finished and the employee is left the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant
From there there are three possibilities,Relevant
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
After each possibility the process ends,Relevant
We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances,Irrelevant
When the agency has given a service to one of his clients a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery,Irrelevant
If the invoice is not correct the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant
If the invoice is correct the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant
When the invoice has been sent the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant
If the payment arrives within 5 days the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not the case the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant
After this call if the payment has been completed within 5 days the process ends,Relevant
If not the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
To finish the process there are two possibilities,Relevant
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above,Irrelevant
The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs get a response from the client charge him and inform DJM,Relevant
The first contact always starts within Proximus stores but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over firstly the manager,Relevant
The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant
If the customer refuses the offer the process is over,Relevant
On the other hand if the customer is interested in the pack the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs S M L,Relevant
These packs are categorized according to their size options and functionality,Irrelevant
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
Once the customer has made his choice the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer s new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies DJM and Proximus,Relevant
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
When the website is prepared it is sent to the customer who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant
If the client is satisfied with the website it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant
If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days a reminder message is sent,Relevant
This process starts when the client who has already chosen either the M pack or the L pack is interested in receiving an e shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
After invoicing in a Proximus shop the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant
Then it s the webmaster who produces the e shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant
This process ends when the e shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant
If he can resolve it directly he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e mail,Relevant
The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant
If the documents are incomplete the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant
If the documents are complete the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant
After the interview if the candidate is hired an email is also sent to inform him her of the news,Relevant
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
If he she notices that he she is missing data he she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant
Then he creates the contract which he then sends,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
Then the first task is made by the Head of department who has to give specific criteria of the job requirements skills needed,Relevant
Once the task is completed the HR employee has to see if it is a specific more special demand or not,Relevant
Usually for nurses they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant
For more specific functions they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant
For more special requests for example energy engineer they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant
After having collected the CV the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department s criteria,Relevant
If there are a lot of applications he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant
Due to the written exam he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant
Once the task is completed he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant
If he didn t approve it a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant
The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant
If he doesn t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant
Finally the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant s information and create the employment contract,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished = applicant employed,Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood pressure and so on,Relevant
These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service which allows the doctor even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant
The doctor specialist has to check the patient s data,Relevant
based on that he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant
If he considers that it is not urgent he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant
Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
Finally the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax usually to the pharmacy,Relevant
In all hospitals there is a pharmacy so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant
The pharmacy checks if they have everything usually they have everything,Relevant
If some medications are missing they have to inform the nurse of the product s non availability,Relevant
Then they have to check the availability of the medications in another service and send someone to take them,Relevant
Once they have received the medications they have to notify the nurse prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant
The last task is made by the nurse who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant
Once the task is done the process is finished = medications prepared,Relevant
There are several possible cases ,Irrelevant
In case of end of contract At the end of the contract replacement contract fixed term contract there is nothing is simply over for the employee,
In case of dismissal Dismissal can be caused by many things usual causes,Relevant
If the dis missal is sufficiently justified HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant
In the event of a decision to discontinue e,Relevant
redirection to another hospital It is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flémalle this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant
However the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant
When a patient wishes to make an appointment he can do so through three different channels this can be done by phone by mail or on the spot at the counter,Relevant
In all three cases the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant
However if it is done by e mail it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant
The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient then an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
The patient has to pay directly on the spot he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant
After waiting in the waiting room the doctor sees the patient,Relevant
He will check the patient s medical history in the CPR computerized patient record examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant
Eventually the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software Carpark,Irrelevant
Indeed Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries the number plate the intern references but also the location of the maintenance the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers  Moreover drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers depending on the bus,Relevant
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
Of course more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant
Lastly Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
With this complaint a driver signals a damage a breakdown or an accident after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant
The content of the complaint is the following the problem the vehicle concerned its kilometers travelled and if the driver wants to his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant
If the problem is considered as urgent the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant
Otherwise the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant
If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant
Following the daily planning of the mechanics the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant
With the use of a clocking software each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant
That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant
Moreover the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock,Relevant
Once the mechanic has finished the repairs the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
Of course in order to make repairs on busses it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant
It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders communicate them to the suppliers take the delivery control and approve the invoices,Relevant
Once a new piece arrives either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent or the piece enters the stock,Relevant
Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair as mentioned previously and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement a shelf and a level,Relevant
Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don t own any cistern,Irrelevant
This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software Telenaro where the internal tanks are continuously updated and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant
Telenaro gathers all the societies vehicles of the group internal and external drivers and data related type of vehicle maximum level of the fuel tank baseline consumption current consumption and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant
That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations vehicles and cisterns,Relevant
Moreover the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant
Lastly Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel the deltas given by the probes see further the alerts from problems during a delivery etc,Relevant
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on live view of the fuel level,Relevant
In parallel to the probes the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant
The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles ie the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption in winter a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars ,Irrelevant
The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft which triggers an alarm,Relevant
It even gives the level of water in the cistern due to the condensation in the cisterns so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
Most importantly the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
To know if any tankage is required the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars see the adjacent illustration,Irrelevant
In addition the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant
When the operator decides that an order is needed he calls for tenders and the best price gets the order,Relevant
Then the manager makes the order to the supplier and sends an email to the subsidiaries in order to inform the local managers of the upcoming resupply,Relevant
All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant
After the tankage the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant
If they do not correspond the system asks the delivery man to re encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant
After three times asking for re encodage if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant
Then the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant
The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for ,Relevant
? Rolling stock buses for regular lines scholar lines tourisms but also trailers for the luggages ,Relevant
? No rolling stock supplies for the garages tools compressors ,Relevant
? Properties buildings but also air conditioning garage doors led lights bus wash ,Relevant
? IT infrastructures cabling laptops desktops servers magnetic access cards surveillance cameras ,Relevant
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
Once the investment request is completed the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant
If the management validates the purchase the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant
Once the investment request has been signed it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant
In order to close the process the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant
The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant
Of course case by case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant
In fact 76 of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant
For example all the OPEX Operational Expenditures that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant
If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier in order to compare the price quality ratios the delivery time the quality of the after sales service etc,Relevant
here again exceptions are of course possible,Irrelevant
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
Besides those master contracts the company also has some price conventions and other pre negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant
Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
Once the information has been collected through market analysis the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant
The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant
After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested a first offer is created,Relevant
This offer needs to be signed by several managers if the offer is not appropriated it might compromise the sale,Relevant
After having been signed the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant
If the client directly accepts the offer the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant
But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant
Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain but that almost never occurs generally if the second offer is still not validated by the client the sale is cancelled,Relevant
At the beginning of each month the account of more than 40 small societies that all kept their legal entity need to be closed in 4 working days,
To do so a lot of accountants work in the subsidiaries and each of them close two or three files within 4 days,
Their work mainly consists in verifying and gathering the invoices as well as the charges,
For the invoices the ones that concern the regular services and the scholar services come directly from the manager at the moment of the service provision and immediately verified by the accountant,
On the other side for the taxis the tourism sector invoices to be drawn up are used because the very end of the service needs to be reached in order to know the total costs engaged,
For the charges the accountants have to look into the salaries and wages,
In the organisation those are based on the real pay on what has actually been paid with almost no accounting provisions,
All the other types of charges are also taken into account rent provisions fuel costs charges from invoices that still need to be drawn up properties maintenance  As mentioned right above within 4 working days starting at the 1st of the month the accountants have to close their files and send them to the management accountants for verification and for a fist analysis,
Keolis Belgium comprises 3 management accountants one for Wallonia one for Flanders and one for Brussel,
Thus on the 4th of the month they verify the work of the accountants according to the budgetization of the month and the year the fluctuations from month to month etc,
They have a more global vision that is both operational and budgetary,
After receiving the approval from the management accountants the accountants inject the files in BOFINANCE the reporting tool used by Keolis SA that has its headquarters in France,
The headquarter then consolidates the accounts and adds on top operations such as adjusted depreciation expenses to make those accounts correspond to the International Financial Reporting Standards,
The 3 management accountants then receive the consolidated accounts consolidate them again into 3 reports one for each region and a second analysis takes place estimation of the gaps between the non consolidated and the consolidated accounts identification of the impact of the events of the month ie the price variation of the fuel on the turnover as well as on each part of the business of the organisation scolar part tourism part regular services part  etc,
This analysis is a from the real to the budget analysis a waterfall of all the impacts is made in order to obtain the budget of the month,
Currently the impact of the covid crisis is at the center of those monthly analyses,
If the impact on scholar transportation is relatively small the one on the tourism sector is huge since all the activities are stationary,
Moreover the reinforcements asked by La TEC that needed more vehicles also have had consequences,
On the 5th day of the month the management accountants send the 3 reports to the directors of each region,
It is indeed important that the results of their analysis are communicated with the operational managers,
Finally on the 6th day of the month the management accountant of Wallonia consolidates the 3 reports in order to obtain one consolidated report for Belgium which is required by the headquarter in France,
Empty bottles are returned by the customers once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant
If the bottles have defects they are rejected and if not they are kept,Relevant
Then the bottles are filled captured labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
The suppliers check the order if it is accepted a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev then the suppliers plan the transportation then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant
Once the trucks are received AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods if everything is good the bottles are stored if not AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks check the goods before storing them,Relevant
purchase order is received at the logistics department if it is a new customer it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant
The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant
If everything is available the order is prepared otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant
Once the beer is ready it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant
AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels Indeed and Forem the People department receives applications,Relevant
1 CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company and when information is missing we send an e mail to warn the candidate,Relevant
If they do not meet the criteria their application will not have been selected,Relevant
2 The telephone interview the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone 5 10 minutes,Relevant
If he is convinced he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant
3 The recruitment morning is a collective interview there is a series of tests,Relevant
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N+1 or N+2,Relevant
4 Interview with the department manager The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
If the candidate is accepted he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant
5 Form Alim training Form Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant
6 The first seasonal contract and coaching When signing the contract the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant
7 The permanent contract If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
After this step we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer then we will cool the beer filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature 3 weeks before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
The aim of this process is to answer positively or not to an employee s holiday request,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to « pending » which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant
Then the request is sent to the manager of the requester s department,Relevant
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
If the manager rejects the request the analyst changes its state to « rejected » and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant
Otherwise if the manager accepts the request the analyst changes the state of the request to « approved » and the first step is done,Relevant
After that the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant
If he doesn t,???
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
To understand it properly it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn t already exist,Irrelevant
In the same way we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant
So in the most common cases the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant
Then he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
Otherwise if after trying to create this page the software realizes that this new resource doesn t refer to an existing project the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
After successfully filling each step the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant
In the same way if during the creation of a new project the software realizes that this project doesn t relate to a registered customer then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
After having registered this new customer the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
This is the role of the second and the third start events which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
If the training has not already been taught in the past then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant
cfr linked subprocess,Irrelevant
Otherwise the manager only has to schedule the session of related training called then a session and contact the external trainer of his choice specialized in this field,Relevant
As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant
1 week before the training s day a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant
After the session the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously ask for a debrief apply the post training process and update attendees  skills in the database,Relevant
That being done the whole process finally ends,Relevant
Subprocess If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant
If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons the training being too expensive too time consuming for the human resources etc the manager has to re evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant
Otherwise the manager can select the language the training will be given in French English or both,Relevant
Finally he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the framework which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in Interco which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
After that the accounting officer clicks on the button send to invoice and the invoice is registered as to be received in FICO which is the general accountancy software,Relevant
Finally the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
Once it is received the invoice gets archived,Relevant
If the company finds an interesting profile the HR employee searches for information about them creates a proposal and sends them an email,Relevant
If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks the process ends,Relevant
However if they accept the proposal the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant
Once the interview has been made the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant
Once the visit and the interview have been carried out a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant
Depending on their result the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant
If the answer is yes the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
If the answer is negative a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant
If accepted the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
In the first case the documents of the applicants their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant
In the second case the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant
Based on these documents the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
Indeed to manufacture a pump for a customer they need material resources and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant
Then three activities have to be done in parallel  Create an X Flow3  Request for quotation to the supplier  Do a framework agreement price matrix it is done to calculate costs of the pump,Relevant
When these 3 tasks are completed the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
If the quality does not meet the expectations they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant
If the quality is good they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant
When the invoice is received they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X Flow which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick off meeting KOM,Relevant
Then the master planner attends the KOM and thanks to the minutes of meeting MOM that he receives by mail he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project s milestones,Relevant
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
Then meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant
In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
Then the business unit makes a project proposal and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
If they say that it is infeasible the process ends,Relevant
But if it is feasible then the business unit the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant
Then those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant
Then they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant
When those tasks are done the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant
Then the three teams above mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
After all these activities the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
When it is done they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre assemble the pump,Relevant
When it is done they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant
Once again they receive a work order and they have to do two activities in parallel do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant
Then when those two activities are done they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant
If the performance is of good quality the pump is dispatched,Relevant
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
If the performance is poor they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
Then they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
If the problem comes from the customer the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant
In the case where the customer is under warranty they apply it,Relevant
If he is not under warranty a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant
If he rejects the quote the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant
The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant
In the case where he accepts the quote or right after having applied the warranty they create a work order WO,Relevant
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
If a big repair has to be done they go on site to do it because of practical reasons then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
If it is only small repairs they do it at Sulzer s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant
Once it is done they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
Before really getting into the recruitment process it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
Applications are received by the HR managers who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant
Once an application is selected an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
Once the candidate has been selected the integration phase begins the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
The integration process On the first day the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant
The employee is given his or her work tools mobile phone PC car and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant
They are told what they need to know about the firm the company s values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
A diagnosis is launched at the customer s premises an employee will describe the company its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
Once the diagnosis has been established the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client s analysis,Relevant
From this moment on improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
Once the diagnosis has been made the areas for improvement put forward it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
Based on this an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant
Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team a project is launched,Relevant
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client s company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
The employees responsible for the project build new tools propose new working methods and processes,Relevant
Workshops are set up at the client s premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company,Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results Resultance employees working at the client s site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
To ensure that the project runs smoothly a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client s internal project manager,Relevant
This makes it possible for example to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant
In addition to this every 4 to 6 weeks a steering committee with the management committee of the client company is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
And finally Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
When a new employee joins the company his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called Workday,Relevant
This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves evaluations sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant
In addition this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
Once a customer has placed an order the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products badge with date of production and expiry date are handled manually,Relevant
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
Then the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
After that the products related to the order can be released,Relevant
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
Then according to the 4 eyes principle another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant
If there is a discrepancy the offer is corrected,Relevant
When the offer is finally approved it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
When this email is received in Belgium the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer ,Relevant
 The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
 The customer can also place orders by e mailing the company,Relevant
When the e mail is received the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
In case of shortage the customer is of course notified,Relevant
 The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI Electronic Data Interchange,Relevant
Once the order is confirmed it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant
After receiving the order the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant
Then a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant
Once the products are picked up they are boxed and packed,Relevant
Then the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
When the products are received by the customer the invoice is sent,Relevant
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
Even if the contact is made by phone an e mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant
Then the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied the right quantity was sent,Relevant
If it is the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant
If the price quantity is not correct the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print sign scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant
Then the customer service also has to print sign scan send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
Due to the digital transformation most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant
So every morning the supply manager when he sees the ERP alert purchases the products missing or practically missing,Relevant
The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote that is a support activity,Relevant
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
Thanks to ERP it is hardly happening,Irrelevant
But if while he is picking products something is missing or the quality is not good enough he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant
Suppliers are listed in the supplier database where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the Customer database,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
If the client does not need delivery or a quote he should go to the cash and carry shop in Droixhe,Relevant
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
If for some reason the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client the financial department will analyze if it could economically be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant
If not the lead will be aborted,Relevant
If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant
Otherwise he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant
When the first quote is made by the salesman or the telemarketer the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant
If the client accepts it the contract will be signed and the order made,Relevant
If not he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed or he might want a better quote,Relevant
The salesman telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
If it is not possible to do a better quote the case will be closed,Relevant
If it is the salesman telemarketer will make the new quote which might once again be approved or refused by the client,Relevant
And so on until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant
When the order arrived at the warehouse if there are some products that need to be pre commanded the manager will do so and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant
Otherwise he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
If the product needed is not there the work must advise the manager so he can report the error corrects the database and purchases the product needed,Relevant
Every time the picker picks something he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant
When all the products of the order are picked the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant
Then if everything is right the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant
If the order is canceled the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer and if the product was not shipped yet the manager will handle the product return,Relevant
When the order is delivered the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant
Then every Monday they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant
If after 14 days they still do not have the payment they will send a reminder,Relevant
If after another 14 days the order is still unpaid the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant
Whether it is by phone or by mail the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant
If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant
After that the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant
To this end the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant
At the same time the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant
In the perspective of an actuarial reservation he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant
In the other perspective the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant
The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable otherwise it s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
In the end a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant
The case is finally settled or unsettled,Relevant
In order to understand the reservation process better it is necessary to clarify its purpose,Irrelevant
Then his insurance will have to compensate him once again,Relevant
That s why on the insurance side they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant
As seen in the claims management process the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant
Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality also they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant
Otherwise the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant
So for this process when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
Nevertheless to find which model to use the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant
