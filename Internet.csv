WU;Exercice 34;1;The apex locator is an electronic device used in endodontics a dental specialty to determine the opening at the apex of the root of a tooth through which the nerve and blood vessels pass,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 34;2;The device presented has a multimedia display and operates with two buttons a power button (ONOFF) and VOLUME button to control the volume of the voice messages that guide the dentist during the measurement process,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 34;3;In addition a demo mode presentation can be started by holding the power button for a few seconds,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 34;4;The device uses a Liion battery and the charging method is similar with this of a cell phone,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 34;5;a) Upon pushing the ONOFF button or plugging in the AC adapter the software program starts the central processing unit and at the same time initializes the display driver,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;6;Once the display is active the software program performs a check to find out if the AC adapter is plugged in,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;7;If this is the case please follow e) if not follow b),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;8;b) If no adapter is plugged in the system checks if the ONOFF button is still pushed,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;9;If the check is negative please follow c) For a positive check follow d),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;10;c) If the ONOFF button is not pushed the system loads an initial display,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;11;Once the initial display is started and the device is ready to measure the software program checks if the VOLUME button has been pushed,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;12;If the check is negative the following process is described in f) if the check is positive follow g),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;13;d) A positive check leads to the activation of the demo mode,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;14;Then the system displays a demo part,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;15;Once it has been displayed the system checks if this has been the last part,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;16;If it is not the last one the process starts over and the system displays the next demo part,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;17;A positive check means that all parts have been presented and leads to the new waiting activity described in k),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;18;e) If the adapter is plugged in the charging program is activated,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;19;Once the charging program is running the system shows a Charging message on the display,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;20;After that the software measures the elapsed time before continuing with further actions (time data is used),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;21;If the waiting time is less than 60 seconds the system continues to wait,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;22;Alternative if the waiting time exceeds 60 seconds the system automatically switches the display off,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;23;Then it regularly checks if any button has been pushed,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;24;When this is the case the Charging message has to be shown again,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;25;If no buttons have been pushed the system proceeds with the waiting activity described in k),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;26;f) For the case that the VOLUME button has not been pushed the device starts with the measurement process deciding which measurement method is most appropriate,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;27;The choice is between method #1 method #2 or none of both,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;28;g) For the case that it has been pushed the volume is increased by one level,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;29;Then either the volume already equals the maximum level which demands the system to mute the device or it is less than the maximum,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;30;Regardless of which case applies the system always performs the VOLUME button check again,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;31;h) If method #1 has been chosen the software program performs it,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;32;Once the method is performed and results are displayed the system makes again the initial decision about which method is most suitable,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;33;i) If method #2 is suitable the system determines whether subprogram #21 or #22 is appropriate and after that performs the chosen one,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;34;After a subprogram has been performed and results are displayed (additionally for #22 as a result log files are saved) the software can choose again an appropriate method,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;35;j) The third option when no appropriate method is found leads also to the waiting activity described in k),Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;36;k) The system now waits again and if 30 seconds have not been exceeded the process starts all over again and the system checks again for an AC adapter,Relevant
WU;Exercice 34;37;Finally in the case that 30 or more seconds have already passed the device automatically turns off,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;1;a) When developing a motherboard the hardware design department selects a chipset that meets the requirements,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;2;The module used by this department is called design software (Design SW is used at every step in this part),Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 35;3;After the chipset reference schematics and the chipset documents have been downloaded the same department proceeds with searching for an appropriate motherboard,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;4;If the board is not close to the custom specification the search process starts again,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;5;Otherwise if a board closest to the custom specification has been found it is then used as a starting schematic,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;6;Then simultaneously the design department adds features from other reference boards and removes the useless features from the selected starting schematic,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;7;b) In the next step the hardware design department adds peripherals,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;8;Then the same department assures if there is an existing BIOS support for the peripherals and at the same time finds all reference boards of the peripherals that are not available on the chipset,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;9;For the case that no BIOS support is available the process of adding of peripherals starts all over again,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;10;Once the reference boards are found the materials management department (module MM) contacts the manufacturers of the peripherals that are not from the chipset,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;11;As a result the manufacturers information is provided,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;12;Once this is done and the BIOS support for all peripherals is available the hardware design department continues to the next step follow c),Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;13;c) The hardware design department now assures that the reference schematics for every peripheral used are available,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;14;If any reference schematic is missing the corresponding peripheral has to be replaced by a new one the process starts over with the activity where peripherals are added,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;15;If all reference schematics are available the hardware design department customizes them which triggers the creation of a schematic symbol library,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;16;Then the materials management department searches for components in every supplier database,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;17;Once all components have been found both the materials management and the hardware design department together gather all components information,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;18;Then in parallel the materials management department updates the description the manufacturer information the product numbers and the suppliers information,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;19;As a result a preliminary schematic is available,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;20;d) Thereafter the materials management department simultaneously generates a preliminary BOM and determines the components prices using the preliminary schematic and the components information,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;21;After that the same department compares the prices,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;22;There are two possible scenarios,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 35;23;The chosen components are either offered at best prices or there are cheaper components on the market,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;24;If the first case applies please follow f),Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;25;For the second case that there are cheaper components on the market the hardware design department checks the components quality,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;26;If the quality of the components is worse than this of the components chosen before please follow f),Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;27;e) For the case that the quality is the same or better the materials management department contacts the new supplier and as a result conditions are negotiated,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;28;Alternatively components may not be available via standard supplier and the materials management contacts directly the manufacturer using the quotation data and the manufacturers contact information,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;29;Consequently a quotation is made,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;30;Regardless of which of the both cases applies the process goes back to adding the new peripherals,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;31;f) In the next step the sales department (using the Sales information system) calculates the price of the prototype and at the same time the price for board quantity of one thousand pieces,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;32;Thereafter the hardware design department is responsible for the following procedures components fitment checking board size checking carrying out of preliminary placement creation of 3D model of the board connectors fitment checking and components height checking (some of the input data used are components chipset 3D data and connectors),Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;33;g) After finishing of all procedures two possible outcomes exist,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;34;In the first case problems have occurred after the previous checks,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;35;This forces the hardware design department to revise the problematic component(s),Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;36;If a peripheral needs to be replaced the whole process starts over from adding a new one,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;37;If the revision has been successful or the second case applies (when the previous checks are done without any problems) the hardware department finishes the checkup,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;38;As a result a checked schematic and a 3D model of the board are available and also the library is updated,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;39;The materials management department can now order the components,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;40;Once they are received the hardware design department does the final placement,Relevant
WU;Exercice 35;41;As the final outcomes both the placement and the preliminary layout are done,Relevant

WU;Exercice 36;3;If the customer says that he has a reservation she checks the reservation entries using the reservation system,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;4;Then in the case that a reservation entry is found in the system the hostess guides the customer to his table,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;5;b) In any other case if the customer says that he does not have a reservation or a reservation entry cannot be found the hostess searches for a free table,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;6;If a table is found she guides the customer to it,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;7;If not she asks him to wait,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;8;While he is still waiting the hostess searches again for a free table,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;9;In the case that the customer is unwilling to wait he leaves the restaurant and the process is over,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;10;c) Once the customer is at the table the waitress brings the menu,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;11;After that she asks for orders,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;12;The customer either wants to order or not,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;13;d) For a customer that wants to order the waitress takes the order using the ordering system,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;14;The customer may want something to drink something to eat or both*,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;15;In the first case the waitress passes the order to the bartender and once the drinks are ready she serves them,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;16;In the second case the same process applies to the meals (here the order is passed to the kitchen),Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;17;After the order is served the waitress waits until the customer finishes his meal,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;18;Once this he has finished she asks again for orders,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;19;*The case when a customer orders several meals in one go is ignored,Irrelevant
WU;Exercice 36;20;e) For a customer that does not want to order the waitress has to determine the reason,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;21;The customer either does not have more orders or alternative he is still not ready with his order,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;22;f) If the customer is still not ready the waitress waits,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;23;Then after the customer has called the waitress or appropriate time is left the waitress asks again for orders,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;24;g) If the customer does not want to order more the waitress brings the bill,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;25;Here the order and billing data are needed for the billing system,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;26;Once the bill is at the table the waitress determines the payment method,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;27;Customers normally either want to pay cash in which case the waitress settles the bill immediately or want to pay with credit card,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;28;In the second case she brings the mobile POS (mobile POS system),Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;29;In the next step the customer pays with his credit card and as a result the bill is settled,Relevant
WU;Exercice 36;30;Finally the customer leaves the restaurant and the process is over,Relevant

MadeHow;Baking Soda Manufacturing Process;17;Powdered #1 and fine granular #2 have a wide range of uses in foods chemicals and pharmaceuticals,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baking Soda Manufacturing Process;18;Granular grades #4 and #5 are found in foods and doughnuts cleaning compounds pharmaceuticals and many other products,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baking Soda Manufacturing Process;19;Industrial grade sodium bicarbonate is used in diverse applications including oil well drilling fluids fire extinguishing materials and water treatment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baking Soda Manufacturing Process;20;Each grade goes to a holding bin wherein atmosphere carbon dioxide and moisture content are controlled to cure the product,Relevant
MadeHow;Baking Soda Manufacturing Process;21;Once cured the grades are ready to be packaged and shipped,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;1;There are four major parts to a standard ball bearing the outer race the rolling balls the inner race and the cage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;2;Both races are made in almost the same way,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;3;Since they are both rings of steel the process starts with steel tubing of an appropriate size,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;4;Automatic machines similar to lathes use cutting tools to cut the basic shape of the race leaving all of the dimensions slightly too large,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;5;The reason for leaving them too large is that the races must be heat treated before being finished and the steel usually warps during this process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;6;They can be machined back to their finished size after heat treating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;7;The rough cut races are put into a heat treating furnace at about 1550 degrees Fahrenheit (843 degrees Celsius) for up to several hours (depending on the size of the parts) then dipped into an oil bath to cool them and make them very hard,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;8;This hardening also makes them brittle so the next step is to temper them,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;9;This is done by heating them in a second oven to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (1488 degrees Celsius) and then letting them cool in air,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;11;This whole heat treatment process makes parts which are both hard and tough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;12;After the heat treatment process the races are ready for finishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;13;However the races are now too hard to cut with cutting tools so the rest of the work must be done with grinding wheels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;14; These are a lot like what you would find in any shop for sharpening drill bits and tools except that several different kinds and shapes are needed to finish the races,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;15;Almost every place on the race is finished by grinding which leaves a very smooth accurate surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;16;The surfaces where the bearing fits into the machine must be very round and the sides must be flat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;17;The surface that the balls roll on is ground first and then lapped,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;18;This means that a very fine abrasive slurry is used to polish the races for several hours to get almost a mirror finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;19;At this point the races are finished and ready to be put together with the balls,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;20;The balls are a little more difficult to make even though their shape is very simple,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;21;Surprisingly the balls start out as thick wire,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;22;This wire is fed from a roll into a machine that cuts off a short piece and then smashes both ends in toward the middle,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;23;This process is called cold heading,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;24;Its name comes from the fact that the wire is not heated before being smashed and that the original use for the process was to put the heads on nails (which is still how that is done),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;25;At any rate the balls now look like the planet Saturn with a ring around the middle called flash,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;26;The first machining process removes this flash,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;27;The ball bearings are put between the faces of two cast iron disks where they ride in grooves,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;28;The inside of the grooves are rough which tears the flash off of the balls,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;29;One wheel rotates while the other one stays still,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;30;The stationary wheel has holes through it so that the balls can be fed into and taken out of the grooves,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;31;A special conveyor feeds balls into one hole the balls rattle around the groove and then come out the other hole,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;32;They are then fed back into the conveyor for many trips through the wheel grooves until they have been cut down to being fairly round almost to the proper size and the flash is completely gone,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;33;Once again the balls are left oversize so that they can be ground to their finished size after heat treatment,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;34;The amount of steel left for finishing is not much only about 81000 of an inch (02 centimeter) which is about as thick as two sheets of paper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;35;The heat treatment process for the balls is similar to that used for the races since the kind of steel is the same and it is best to have all the parts wear at about the same rate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;36;Like the races the balls become hard and tough after heat treating and tempering,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;37;After heat treatment the balls are put back into a machine that works the same way as the flash remover except that the wheels are grinding wheels instead of cutting wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;38;These wheels grind the balls down so that they are round and within a few ten thousandths of an inch of their finished size,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;39;After this the balls are moved to a lapping machine which has cast iron wheels and uses the same abrasive lapping compound as is used on the races,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;40;Here they will be lapped for 810 hours depending on how precise a bearing they are being made for,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;41;Once again the result is steel that is extremely smooth,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;42;Steel cages are stamped out of fairly thin sheet metal much like a cookie cutter and then bent to their final shape in a die,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;43;A die is made up of two pieces of steel that fit together with a hole the shape of the finished part carved inside,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;44;When the cage is put in between and the die is closed the cage is bent to the shape of the hole inside,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;45;The die is then opened and the finished part is taken out ready to be assembled,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;46;Plastic cages are usually made by a process called injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;47;In this process a hollow metal mold is filled by squirting melted plastic into it and letting it harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;48;The mold is opened up and the finished cage is taken out ready for assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;49;Now that all of the parts are made the bearing needs to be put together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;50;The inner race is put inside the outer race only off to one side as far as possible,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;51;This makes a space between them on the opposite side large enough to insert balls between them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;52;The required number of balls is put in then the races are moved so that they are both centered and the balls distributed evenly around the bearing,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;53;At this point the cage is installed to hold the balls apart from each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;54;Plastic cages are usually just snapped in while steel cages usually have to be put in and riveted together,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Manufacturing Process ;55;Now that the bearing is assembled it is coated with a rust preventative and packaged for shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;1;Prior to painting the body must pass through a rigorous inspection process the body in white operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;2;The shell of the vehicle passes through a brightly lit white room where it is fully wiped down by visual inspectors using cloths soaked in hilight oil,Relevant

MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;4;Dings dents and any other defects are repaired right on the line by skilled body repairmen,Relevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;5;After the shell has been fully inspected and repaired the assembly conveyor carries it through a cleaning station where it is immersed and cleaned of all residual oil dirt and contaminants,Relevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;6;As the shell exits the cleaning station it goes through a drying booth and then through an undercoat dip—an electrostatically charged bath of undercoat paint (called the Ecoat) that covers every nook and cranny of the body shell both inside and out with primer,Relevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;7;This coat acts as a substrate surface to which the top coat of colored paint adheres,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;8;After the Ecoat bath the shell is again dried in a booth as it proceeds on to the final paint operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Car assembling paint ;9;In most automobile assembly plants today vehicle bodies are spraypainted by robots that have been programmed to apply the exact amounts of paint to just the right areas for just the right length of time,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Car  Interior assembly ;2;Next robots equipped with suction cups remove the windshield from a shipping container apply a bead of urethane sealer to the perimeter of the glass and then place it into the body windshield frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Interior assembly ;3;Robots also pick seats and trim panels and transport them to the vehicle for the ease and efficiency of the assembly operator,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Interior assembly ;4;After passing through this section the shell is given a water test to ensure the proper fit of door panels glass and weatherstripping,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Interior assembly ;5;It is now ready to mate with the chassis,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;1;The chassis assembly conveyor and the body shell conveyor meet at this stage of production,Relevant

MadeHow;Car  Mate;4;Once the mating takes place the automobile proceeds down the line to receive final trim components battery tires antifreeze and gasoline,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;5;The vehicle can now be started,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;6;From here it is driven to a checkpoint off the line where its engine is audited its lights and horn checked its tires balanced and its charging system examined,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;7;Any defects discovered at this stage require that the car be taken to a central repair area usually located near the end of the line,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;8;A crew of skilled troubleshooters at this stage analyze and repair all problems,Relevant
MadeHow;Car  Mate;9;When the vehicle passes final audit it is given a price label and driven to a staging lot where it will await shipment to its destination,Relevant
MadeHow; Car  Quality control;1;Once the component parts of the automobile begin to be assembled at the automotive factory production control specialists can follow the progress of each embryonic automobile by means of its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) assigned at the start of the production line,Relevant
MadeHow; Car  Quality control;2;In many of the more advanced assembly plants a small radio frequency transponder is attached to the chassis and floor pan,Irrelevant
MadeHow; Car  Quality control;3;This sending unit carries the VIN information and monitors its progress along the assembly process,Relevant

lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;1;Here is the life of how an automobile is manufactured,Irrelevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;2;Step 1 The metal is delivered to the manufacturing plant and placed on an assembly line,Relevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;3;Here it is pressed and ironed by heat to the correct thickness for the needed part,Relevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;4;It is then stamped into the correct auto part door fenders roofs and hoods,Relevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;5;This process is more precise because of the use of the robotic arms that measure each piece,Irrelevant

lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;10;After each piece is welded into place it is inspected to ensure that it meets all expectations,Relevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;11;This is one of the hardest parts of the process because it involves not only the robot being programmed correctly but also depends on the inspectors understanding when a piece just doesnt fit right,Irrelevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;12;Step 3 The next part is the one that gives it a clean shiny glow,Irrelevant
lerablogorg;Car Manufacturing Process;13;The body of the car gets a nice warm shower to wash away the dirt and grime of the assembly process,Relevant

interestingengineeringcom;Marbles;7;The stillhot slugs then pass through a series of constantly rotating metal ridged rollers that keep the slugs separated while cooling them and giving them their signature spherical shape,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Marbles;8;The marbles final appearance or coloring was determined in the kiln as air passed coloring through the molten glass,Irrelevant
interestingengineeringcom;Marbles;9;Solidified marbles are then sorted by size,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;1;Firstly the metal jacket for the bullet is formed from stretching copper cups to receive the lead core at a later stage,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;2;Hornady prefers to use mechanical force to achieve this rather than heating and molding,Irrelevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;3;This takes several stages to gradually stretch the copper to its desired length and diameter,Irrelevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;4;A lead core is later added inside the jacket,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;5;Further stages of mechanical force are used to slowly form the characteristic bullet shape,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;6;This reshaping leads to excess lead being forced out of the top of the bullet,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;7;These are trimmed off,Relevant
interestingengineeringcom;Bullets ;8;Further forced reshaping occurs and once again excess lead is trimmed off the nose until the complete finalized bullet shape is achieved,Relevant

MadeHow;Air Bag ;1;The following description of the manufacturing process is for driverside air bag module assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;2;Passengerside air bag module assemblies are produced slightly differently,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;3;The propellant consists of sodium azide mixed together with an oxidizer a substance that helps the sodium azide to burn when ignited,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;4;The sodium azide is received from outside vendors and inspected to make sure it conforms to requirements,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;5;After inspection it is placed in a safe storage place until needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;6;At the same time the oxidizer is received from outside vendors inspected and stored,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;7;Different manufacturers use different oxidizers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;8;From storage the sodium azide and the oxidizer are then carefully blended under sophisticated computerized process control,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;9;Because of the possibility of explosions the powder processing takes place in isolated bunkers,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;10;If the event safety sensors detect a spark high speed deluge systems will douse whole rooms with water,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;11;Production occurs in several redundant smaller facilities so that if an accident does occur production will not be shut down only decreased,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;12;After blending the propellant mixture is sent to storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;13;Presses are then used to compress the propellant mixture into disk or pellet form,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;14;The inflator components such as the metal canister the filter assembly—stainless steel wire mesh with ceramic material inside—and initiator (or igniter) are received from outside vendors and inspected,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;15;The components are then assembled on a highly automated production line,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;16;The inflator subassembly is combined with the propellant and an initiator to form the inflator assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;17;Laser welding (using CO 2 gas) is used to join stainless steel inflator subassemblies while friction inertial welding is used to join aluminum inflator subassemblies,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;18;Laser welding entails using laser beams to weld the assemblies together while friction inertial welding involves rubbing two metals together until the surfaces become hot enough to join together,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;19;The inflator assembly is then tested and sent to storage until needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;20;The woven nylon air bag fabric is received from outside vendors and inspected for any material defects,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;21;The air bag fabric is then die cut to the proper shapes and sewn internally and externally to properly join the two sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;22;After the air bag is sewn it is inflated and checked for any seam imperfections,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;23;The air bag assembly is then mounted to the tested inflator assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;24;Next the air bag is folded and the breakaway plastic horn pad cover is installed,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;25;Finally the completed module assembly is inspected and tested,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;26;The module assemblies are packaged in boxes for shipment and then sent to customers,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;27;The remaining components of the air bag system—the crash sensors the diagnostic monitoring unit the steering wheel connecting coil and the indicator lamp—are combined with the air bag module during vehicle assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Bag ;28;All the components are connected and communicate through a wiring harness,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;1;Early in the process sometimes even before the leather is cut the lettering—usually foil tape—identifying the manufacturer is burned into the leather with a brass stamping die,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;2;The shell of the glove is sewn together while insideout,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;3;It is then turned rightsideout and its lining is inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;4;Before being reversed the shell is mulled (wetted or  steamed for flexibility) so that it doesnt crack or rip when it is turned,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;5;The turned shell is put on a device known as a hot hand which is a handshaped metallic form its heat helps the shell form to its correct size,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;6;At this point the hot hand also assures that all the openings for the fingers (finger stalls) are open correctly,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;7;A pad is inserted into the heel of a glove,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;8;Better gloves have twopart pads that make it easier for the glove to flex in the correct direction when squeezed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;9;The padding in a glove is made of two layers of leather hand stitched together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;10;Catchers mitts which need a thicker palm than other gloves are made with five layers of leather padding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;11;At this same point plastic reinforcements are inserted at the thumb and toe (little finger) sections of the glove,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;12;These devices provide added support for the glove and protect the players fingers from being bent backwards accidentally,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;13;Before all the parts of the glove are laced together the web is fabricated out of several pieces of leather,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;14;The web can consist of anywhere from two to six pieces of leather depending on the type of web desired,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;15;The lacing around the edges of a glove is usually one piece of rawhide that might be as much as 8090 inches (203228 centimeters) long,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;16;The lacing begins at the thumb or little finger and holds the entire glove together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;17;The final lacing operation is at the web section,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;18;Some nonleather stitching is needed for the individual parts—the web for instance is usually stitched together with nylon thread,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;19;The strap across the back of the hand of a glove used to be lined with shearling (sheepskin) a synthetic material is now used,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;20;Catchers mitts and first base gloves 1 O are hand assembled and sewn from four parts—palm pad back and web,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;21;The palm and back are sewn together first and then joined together with the other pieces with rawhide lacing,Relevant
MadeHow;Baseball Glove;22;The final step is called a lay off operation the glove is again placed on a hot hand to adjust any shaping problems and to make sure that the openings for the fingers (finger stalls) have remained open throughout the manufacturing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;1;In an alkaline battery the cathode actually doubles as part of the container,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;2;Huge loads of the constituent ingredients—manganese dioxide carbon black (graphite) and an electrolyte (potassium hydroxide in solution)—are delivered by train and mixed in very large batches at the production site,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;3;The mixture is then granulated and pressed or compacted into hollow cylinders called preforms,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;4; Depending on the size of the battery being made several preforms may be stacked one on top of another in a battery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;5;Alternatively the series of preforms can be replaced by an extruded ring of the same material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;6;The preforms are next inserted into a nickelplated steel can the combination of the preforms and the steel can make up the cathode of the battery,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;7;In a large operation the cans are made at the battery factory using standard cutting and forming techniques,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;8;An indentation is made near the top of the can and an asphalt or epoxy sealant is placed above the indentation to protect against leakage,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;9;A paper separator soaked in the electrolyte solution is then inserted inside the can against the preforms the separator is made from several pieces of paper laid at crossgrains to each other (like plywood),Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;10;Looking down at an open can one would see what looks like a paper cup inserted into the can,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;11;The separator keeps the cathode material from coming into contact with the anode material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;12;As an alternative a manufacturer might use a porous synthetic fiber for the same purpose,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;13;The anode goes into the battery can next,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;14;It is a gel composed primarily of zinc powder along with other materials including a potassium hydroxide electrolyte,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;15;This gel has the consistency of a very thick paste,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;16;Rather than a solution it is chemically a suspension in which particles do not settle (though an appropriate filter could separate them),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;17;The gel does not fill the can to the top so as to allow space for the chemical reactions that will occur once the battery is put into use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;18;Though the battery is able to produce electricity at this point an open cell is not practical and would exhaust its potential rapidly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;19;The battery needs to be sealed with three connected components,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;20;The first a brass nail or long spike is inserted into the middle of the can through the gel material and serves as a current collector,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;21;The second is a plastic seal and the third a metal end cap,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;22;The nail which extends about twothirds of the way into the can is welded to the metal end cap and then passed through the plastic seal,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;23;This seal is significantly thinner in some places than in others so that if too much gas builds up in the can the seal will rupture rather than the entire battery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;24;Some battery designs make use of a waxfilled hole in the plastic excess gas pushes through the wax rather than rupturing the battery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;25;The seal assembly meets the indentation made in the can at the beginning of the process and is crimped in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;26;The opposite end of the can (the positive end of the battery) is then closed with a steel plate that is either welded in place or glued with an epoxytype cement,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;27;Before the battery leaves the factory a label is added identifying the type of battery its size and other information,Relevant
MadeHow;Battery;28;The label is often paper that is simply glued to the battery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Battery;29;One large manufacturer has its label design printed on plastic shrink wrap a loose fitting piece of heatsensitive plastic is wrapped around the battery can and then exposed to a blast of heat that makes the plastic shrink down to fit tightly around the can,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;1;Although more clothing manufacturers are making and distributing bicycle shorts for general sport and even nonathletic use this section will describe how the short designed for the professional cyclist is manufactured,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;2;First the fabric (usually a blend of polyester cotton spandex and nylon) must be manufactured,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;3;This involves spinning and combining the various threads into a single fabric washing and drying the fabric and then dyeing it,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;4;Next it is saturated or sprayed with a water resistant finish before being cut into panels according to pattern specifications set by the designer,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;5;The various panels are then carefully sewn together,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;6;To avoid raised ridges seams may be offset for a smoother finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;7;Finally elastic is inserted in the waistband of the sewn short,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;8;Gripper elastic bands are also sewn into the cuffs at the shorts hem,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;9;The chamois liners layers are cut out according to pattern specifications before being bonded or laminated together,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;10;After assembly they are stitched along the outer edges to prevent fraying,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;11;Sometimes a special thread similar to a soft floss is used to prevent chafing,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;12;The finished product will have a molded look,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;13;It is usually inserted inside the bicycle short with a strip of tape to hold it in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;14;Several manufacturers have developed a onepiece chamois that does not require any seams and avoids any overlapping of material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;15;The completed bicycle short is tested for defects,Relevant
MadeHow;Bicycle Shorts;16;After passing inspection it is ready to be packaged and shipped to a retailer,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;1;The bulb can be made using various processes but it is most commonly produced using vacuumassisted injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;2;Compressed air is used to blow the melted rubber or neoprene material into the cavity of a twopiece metal die set featuring the negative image of the bulb (the operation resembles blowing a gum bubble inside a bottle),Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;3;The die also contains small holes through which air is drawn out just before the material is injected helping it flow into the die cavity at a uniform thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;4;While these holes are large enough to allow air to escape they are too small to permit significant amounts of the rubber to seep out,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;5;The remnant of the rubber material that is drawn into the holes produces small protuberances that resemble the small whiskers visible on a new tire,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;6;Within a few seconds of its injection the material has cooled so that the die may be opened revealing the finished bulb,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;7;After a minimal amount of hand work to remove the whiskers the bulb is ready to be attached to the other components,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;8;The valves are made by die casting plastic injection molding and machining from bar material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;9;They incorporate connection features that allow the bulb and hose to be attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;10;Machined valves can be made on a lathe controlled by a computer program that instructs it to turn the shape threads and other features,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;11;The gauge consists of further subassemblies each of which contains machined molded and stamped parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;12;The most important component of the gauge is the pressure element,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;13;It is constructed by soldering two disks together at the formed lip to construct a hollow wafer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;14;The pressure from the system is introduced into the wafer though a hole in the socket connection which in turn is connected to the squeeze bulb and cuff,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;15;As the internal pressure increases the wafer swells,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;16;It is this swelling that is detected by the movement assembly causing the pointer to rotate about the dial,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;17;After assembly the gauge must be calibrated,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;18;This is accomplished by connecting it to a pressure source with a master gauge of known accuracy,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;19;Slight adjustments are made in the movement linkage until the pointer of the gauge reflects the correct pressure readings,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;20;The constricting cuff or bladder is made by heat sealing two rubber sheets together to form a flexible band,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;21;A tubing fitting is incorporated into this sealing process providing a connection for the air supply,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;22;A fabric covering is then sewn to the bladder by conventional methods,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;23;The hoses are made by continuous extrusion a process in which pellets of rubber or similar material are heated to the melting point at which they become claylike and viscous,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;24;Within the same machine a rotating screw device forces this molten material through a die block which is simply a hole in an aluminum block the same size as the outside of the tubing,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;25;Secured within the block is a rod that is the same size as the inside of the tubing and positioned in the center of the hole,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;26;As the material flows around the rod and out the hole it cools and assumes the shape of the tubing,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;27;At this point it is cut to length and coiled onto spools for shipment to the assembly facility,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;28;At final assembly hoses are used to connect the components discussed above,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;29;The hoses are then checked for leaks and the calibration is verified,Relevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;30;This is a good example of JIT (justintime) material requirements planning and TQC (totalqualityconcept) management,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;31;Missing any one of the components the entire assembly is useless,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;32;The plant must receive the parts and supplies in a timely manner to assure delivery of the finished product to the customer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;33;The items must be of satisfactory quality so they can be assembled correctly and without compromising the design,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;34;Many companies today have established quality management procedures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blood Pressure Monitor ;35;These procedures are simply intensive studies of all aspects of manufacture to eliminate or reduce the possibility of producing a defective part,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;1;Denim unlike many types of cloth (which are woven in one place and sent to another for dying) is woven and dyed at one location,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;2;There are several steps between ginned cotton (cotton after it has been picked from fields and processed) and cotton yarn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;3;The incoming cotton is removed from tightly packed bales and inspected before undergoing a process known as carding,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;4; In this process the cotton is put through machines that contain brushes with bent wire teeth,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;5;These brushes—called cards —clean disentangle straighten and gather together the  cotton fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;6;At this point the fibers are called slivers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;7;Other machines join several slivers together and these slivers are then pulled and twisted which serves to make the threads stronger,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;8;Next these ropes are put on spinning machines that further twist and stretch the fibers to form yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;9;Some cloths are woven (see step 5 below) and then dyed but denim is usually dyed with chemically synthesized indigo before being woven,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;10;Large balls of yarn called ball warps are dipped in the indigo mixture several times so that the dye covers the yarn in layers,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;11;(These many layers of indigo dye explain why blue jeans fade slightly with each washing),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;12;Although the exact chemicals used in such dyeing procedures remain trade secrets it is known that a small amount of sulfur is often used to stabilize the top or bottom layers of indigo dye,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;13;The dyed yarn is then slashed that is it is coated with sizing (any one of a variety of starchy substances) to make the threads stronger and stiffer,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;14;Once this operation is complete the yarn threads are ready to woven with undyed filling yarn threads,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;15;The yarn is then woven on large mechanical looms,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;16;Denim is not 100 percent blue as the blue dyed threads forming the warp (long vertical threads) are combined with white threads forming the weft (shorter horizontal  threads),Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;17;Because denim is woven with the blue threads packed closer together than the white threads and with the blue threads covering three out of four white threads the blue threads dominate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;18;(By examining a piece of denim closely one can detect the steep diagonal pattern that results from this process which is known as a threebyone righthand twill weave),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;19;Although mechanized looms make use of the same basic weaving procedure as a simple hand loom they are much larger and faster,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;20;A modern shuttleless loom (which uses a very small carrier instead of the traditional shuttle to weave the weft threads between the warp threads) may produce as much as 3279 yards (3000 meters) of cloth 328 or 437 yards (three or four meters) wide in a single week,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;21;As much as 1093 yards (1000 meters) of cloth may be rolled into a single huge bolt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;22;At this point the denim is ready for finishing a term referring to a variety of treatments applied to cloth after it is woven,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;23;With denim finishing is usually fairly simple,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;24;The cloth is brushed to remove loose threads and lint and the denim is usually skewed in a way that will prevent it from twisting when it is made into clothing,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;25;The denim may then be sanforized or preshrunk,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;26;Preshrunk denim should shrink no more than three percent after three washings,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;27;Once the desired design is selected patterns from the design are cut from heavy paper or cardboard,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;28;Up to 80 different sizes are possible from one pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;29;The pieces of denim are then cut with high speed cutting machines from stacks 100 layers thick,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;30;Excluding rivets buttons and zippers a pair of blue jeans contains about ten different pieces from the pockets to the leg panels to the waistband and belt loops,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;31;The pieces of denim are ready to be sewn at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;32;Sewing is done in an assembly line fashion with rows of industrial humanoperated sewing machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;33;Each sewer is assigned a specific function such as making only back pockets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;34;First the various pockets and belt loops are assembled,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;35;Next one sewer attaches the pockets to the leg seams another then sews the leg seams together and still another attaches the waistband,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;36;Once the waist band is secure the belt loops may be stitched on and the buttons attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;37;If the jeans include a zipper it is then sewn into place and the pants are hemmed,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;38;Finally the rivets are placed in the appropriate places and the makers label is sewn on last,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;39;Some jeans are prewashed andor stonewashed to alter the appearance or texture of the finished jeans,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;40;Prewashing involves washing the jeans in industrial detergent for a short time to soften the denim,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;41;Stonewashing also means washing the jeans but pumice is added to the load resulting in a faded appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;42;Small stones (less than one inch [one centimeter] in diameter) produce an even abrasion while large stones (about four inches [10 centimeters] in diameter) highlight the seams and pockets and produce a more uneven appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;43;The completed pair of blue jeans is I 0 then pressed,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;44;They are placed into a large pressing machine that steam irons the entire garment at once in about a minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;45;A size tag is punched into the material and the jeans are folded stacked and placed in boxes according to style color and size before being sent to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Blue Jeans Monitor;46;When the jeans are selected to be sent to a store they are put in large shipping cartons and sent on freight trains or trucks,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;1;After the book is written and appropriate design elements are agreed upon book production can begin,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;2;The first stage is typesetting in which the actual text is converted into the appropriate typeface style (known as font) and size (known as point size),Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;3; After the typeset version of the book has been reviewed and any necessary changes made it is ready for printing and binding in which the actual pages are printed and bound together with the cover resulting in a finished book,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;4;The typesetting and printing—printing consists of filming and all subsequent steps—are typically done not by the publisher but by specialized vendors,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;5;First the manuscript is converted into the desired font and point size,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;6;If the manuscript has not been completed on a computer it must be typed into a computer by the typesetter,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;7;If it is already in electronic form however the typesetter simply has to make programming changes to convert the manuscript into the proper style,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;8;The result is generally (but not always see step #3 below) a galley of the text,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;9;A galley form of manuscript consists of long pages of text in a single column,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;10;The galley includes the proper typeface but the proper pagination still must be worked out,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;11;Galleys are then proofread and edited for errors by the publisher,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;12;This stage is particularly important if the manuscript has been typeset (typed) from a hard copy of the text,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;13;If the manuscript was typeset from a computer disk most of the errors should have already been corrected during a review of the manuscript,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;14;The singlecolumn format of galleys facilitates the proofreading,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;15;After galleys are thoroughly proofed and edited pages (or lasers) are produced,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;16;An exact layout of typeset pages but usually printed on standard typing paper pages are also reviewed for accuracy by the publisher,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;17;Some books skip the galley stage and proceed directly to pages,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;18;Once any necessary changes have been made the typesetter then produces a mechanical of the typeset pages,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;19;Also called camera copy the mechanical is printed on highquality paper that is suitable for filming the first stage in the printing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;20;The work of the typesetting vendor—if different from the publisher—is now done,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;21;The typeset mechanical now goes to the printing and binding vendor,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;22;First each text page including line drawings is photographed (or shot) using a large camera to produce page negatives,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;23;These negatives are the opposite of what will actually print,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;24;In other words the text and photos will appear backward in negative form,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;25;Negatives are then checked to make sure there are no blemishes present,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;26;While printed words and line drawings are all one shade of black photographs have many shades from palest gray to deepest black and must be filmed using a special process to maintain these shades,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;27;The process converts the shades into black and white dots—very light areas have many dots while darker areas have fewer dots,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;28;The converted photographs are known as halftones,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;29; If the book will have more than one color of ink a separate negative for each color is made,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;30;For color photos for instance four negatives are generally used cyan magenta yellow and black,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;31;For this reason books with color will have negative overlays (one negative overlay for each color),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;32;Because of the added overlays a book printed in more than one color involves additional preparation and cost,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;33;The negatives are then taped or stripped into their proper place onto a large sheet called a goldenrod or a flat,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;34; Each flat holds 32 or 64 pages and enough flats are used to equal the number of pages in the book,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;35;Strippers examine each finished flat on a lineup table to ensure that text and illustrations are properly lined up and in sequence,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;36;(The book pages are not lined up in consecutive order on the flat and in fact some of the pages are placed upside down,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;37;Such placing is necessary because the finished paper version of each flat will be folded several times once the flat is folded the 32 or 64 pages will be in the proper order,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;38;This placement method is known as imposition,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;39;To make this examination process easier the lineup tables are equipped with a fluorescent light that shines up through the negatives so it is easier for the stripper to read and align the text,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;40;To make sure the book is progressing properly a proof of each flat is made by shining ultraviolet light through the negatives to expose their images onto a special lightsensitive paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;41;The resulting pages are called blueprints (or silverprints bluelines or dyluxes) because the paper and ink are blue or silver in appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;42;The blueprints are then checked carefully by the publisher,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;43;If an editor or art director finds an error on a blueprint or decides to make a change the page in question has to be rephotographed,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;44;The new negative will then be stripped onto the flat,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;45;7 After final approval each flat is photographed with the negatives being exposed onto (or burned onto) a thin sheet of aluminum called a plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;46; The sections of the plates that contain text and illustrations are then treated with a chemical that attracts ink thereby ensuring that the text and illustrations will print when on press,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;47;The plates are then sent to press,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;48;If printing in only one color each plate will require only one pass through the press,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;49;If printing more than one color an additional pass will be required for each color,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;50;For example if two colors are used the paper is fed through the press twice,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;51;There are three main printing processes used in book production offset lithography letterpress and gravure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;52; The process used depends less on quality differences than on economic factors such as availability of  machines number of books being printed (the print run) and the speed of delivery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;53;Presses are either sheetfed (single sheets of paper are fed through) or webfed (huge rolls of paper are unwound and run through),Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;54;After the sheets are printed and dry they are delivered to the bindery,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;55;While many large printing companies have their own binderies other smaller printers must send the printed sheets to a outside bindery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;56;At the bindery the flats are folded and collated into book signatures —properly folded 32 or 64page sections—that are then bound in proper sequence,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;57;All of these functions are automated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;58;Book binding also involves sewing the signatures together gluing the spine and inserting lining and trimming the edges,Relevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;59;The amount and type of binding depends on the type of book (paperback or hardback) and its size,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Book Monitor;60;In the final step the book is cased in or enclosed in a cover,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick;1;The initial step in producing brick is crushing and grinding the raw materials in a separator and a jaw crusher,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick;2;Next the blend of ingredients desired for each particular batch is selected and filtered before being sent on to one of three brick shaping processes—extrusion molding or pressing the first of which is the most adaptable and thus the most common,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick;3;Once the bricks are formed and any subsequent procedures performed they are dried to remove excess moisture that might otherwise cause cracking during the ensuing firing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick;4;Next they are fired in ovens and then cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick;5;Finally they are dehacked—automatically stacked wrapped with steel bands and padded with plastic corner protectors,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;1;First each of the ingredients is conveyed to a separator that removes oversize material,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;2;A jaw crusher with horizontal steel plates then squeezes the particles rendering them still smaller,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;3;After the raw materials for each batch of bricks have been selected a scalping screen is often used to separate the different sizes of material,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;4;Material of the correct size is sent to storage silos and oversized material goes to a hammermill which pulverizes it with rapidly moving steel hammers,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;5;The hammermill uses another screen to control the maximum size of particle leaving the mill and discharge goes to a number of vibrating screens that separate out material of improper size before it is sent on to the next phase of production,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;6;With extrusion the most common method of brick forming pulverized material and water are fed into one end of a pug mill which uses knives on a rotating shaft to cut through and fold together material in a shallow chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;7;The blend is then fed into an extruder at the far end of the mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;8;The extruder usually consists of two chambers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;9;The first removes air from the ground clay with a vacuum thereby preventing cracking and other defects,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;10;The second chamber a highpressure cylinder compacts the material so the auger can extrude it through the die,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;11;After it is compressed the plastic material is forced out of the chamber though a specially shaped die orifice,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;12;The crosssection of the extruded column called the pug is formed into the shape of the die,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;13;Sections of desired length are cut to size with rotating knives or stiff wires,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;14;In molding soft wet clay is shaped in a mold usually a wooden box,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;15;The interior of the box is often coated with sand which provides the desired texture and facilitates removing the formed brick from the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;16;Water can also be used to assist release,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;17;Pressing the third type of brick forming requires a material with low water content,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;18;The material is placed in a die and then compacted with a steel plunger set at a desired pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;19;More regular in shape and sharper in outline than brick made with the other two methods pressed bricks also feature frogs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;20;Chamfering machines were developed to produce a furrow in brick for such applications as paving,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;21;These machines use rollers to indent the brick as it is being extruded,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;22;They are sometimes equipped with wire cutters to do the chamfering and cutting in one step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;23;Such machines can produce as many as 20000 units per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;24;The choice of sand coating also applied as the brick is extruded depends on how soft or hard the extruded material is,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;25;A continuous vibrating feeder is used to coat soft material whereas for textured material the coating may have to be brushed or rolled on,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;26;For harder materials a pressure roller or compressed air is used and for extremely hard materials sand blasting is required,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;27;Before the brick is fired it must be dried to remove excess moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;28;If this moisture is not removed the water will burn off too quickly during firing causing cracking,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;29;Two types of dryers are used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;30;Tunnel dryers use cars to move the brick through humiditycontrolled zones that prevent cracking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;31;They consist of a long chamber through which the ware is slowly pushed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;32;External sources of fancirculated hot air are forced into the dryer to speed the process,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;33;Automatic chamber dryers are also used especially in Europe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;34;The extruded bricks are automatically placed in rows on two parallel bars,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;35;The bricks are then fed onto special racks with fingerlike devices that hold several pairs of bars in multiple layers,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;36;These racks are then transferred by railmounted transfer cars or by lift trucks into the dryers,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;37;After drying the brick is loaded onto cars (usually automatically) and fired to  high temperatures in furnaces called kilns,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;38;In general the cars that moved the bricks through the drying process are also used to convey them through the tunnel kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;39;These cars are pushed through the kilns continuously maintained temperature zones at a specific rate that depends on the material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;40;The majority of kilns in the United States use gas as a fuel source though a third of the brick currently produced is fired using solid fuels such as sawdust and coal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;41;Tunnel kilns have changed in design from highload narrowwidth kilns to shorter lowerset wider kilns that can fire more brick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;42;This type of design has also led to highvelocity longflame and lowtemperature flame burners which have improved temperature uniformity and lowered fuel consumption,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;43;After the brick is fired and cooled it is unloaded from the kiln car via the dehacking process which has been automated to the point where almost all manual brickhandling is eliminated,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;44;Automated setting machines have been developed that can set brick at rates of over 18000 per hour and can rotate the brick 180 degrees,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Brick2;45;Usually set in rows eleven bricks wide a stack is wrapped with steel bands and fitted with plastic strips that serve as corner protectors,Relevant
MadeHow;Brick2;46;The packaged brick is then shipped to the job site where it is typically unloaded using boom trucks,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;1;Some bulletproof vests are custommade to meet the customers protection needs or size,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;2;Most however meet standard protection regulations have standard clothing industry sizes (such as 38 long 32 short) and are sold in quantity,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;3;To make Kevlar the polymer polyparaphenylene terephthalamide must first be produced in the laboratory,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;4;This is done through a process known as polymerization which involves combining molecules into long chains,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;5;The resultant crystalline liquid with polymers in the shape of rods is then extruded through a spinneret (a small metal plate full of tiny holes that looks like a shower head) to form Kevlar yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;6;The Kevlar fiber then passes through a cooling bath to help it harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;7;After being sprayed with water the synthetic fiber is wound onto rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;8;The Kevlar manufacturer then typically sends the fiber to throwsters who twist the yarn to make it suitable for weaving,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;9;To make Kevlar cloth the yarns are woven in the simplest pattern plain or tabby weave which is merely the over and under pattern of threads that interlace alternatively,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;10;Unlike Kevlar the Spectra used in bulletproof vests is usually not woven,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;11;Instead the strong polyethylene polymer filaments are spun into fibers that are then laid parallel to each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;12;Resin is used to coat the fibers sealing them together to form a sheet of Spectra cloth,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;13;Two sheets of this cloth are then placed at right angles to one another and again bonded forming a nonwoven fabric that is next sandwiched between two sheets of polyethylene film,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;14;The vest shape can then be cut from the material,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;15;Kevlar cloth is sent in large rolls to the bulletproof vest manufacturer,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;16;The fabric is first unrolled onto a cutting table that must be long enough to allow several panels to be cut out at a time sometimes it can be as  long as 3279 yards (30 meters),Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;17;As many layers of the material as needed (as few as eight layers or as many as 25 depending on the level of protection desired) are laid out on the cutting table,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;18;A cut sheet similar to pattern pieces used for home sewing is then placed on the layers of cloth,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;19;For maximum use of the material some manufacturers use computer graphics systems to determine the optimal placement of the cut sheets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;20;Using a handheld machine that performs like a jigsaw except that instead of a cutting wire it has a 591inch (15centimeter) cutting wheel similar to that on the end of a pizza cutter a worker cuts around the cut sheets to form panels which are then placed in precise stacks,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;21;While Spectra Shield generally does not require sewing as its panels are usually just cut and stacked in layers that go into tight fitting pouches in the vest a bulletproof vest made from Kevlar can be either quiltstitched or boxstitched,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;22;Quiltstitching forms small diamonds of cloth separated by stitching whereas box stitching forms a large single box in the middle of the vest,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;23;Quiltstitching is more labor intensive and difficult and it provides a stiff panel that is hard to shift away from vulnerable areas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;24;Boxstitching on the other hand is fast and easy and allows the free movement of the vest,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;25;To sew the layers together workers place a stencil on top of the layers and rub chalk on the exposed areas of the panel  making a dotted line on the cloth,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;26;A sewer then stitches the layers together following the pattern made by the chalk,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;27;Next a size label is sewn onto the panel,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;28;The shells for the panels are sewn together in the same factory using standard industrial sewing machines and standard sewing practices,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;29;The panels are then slipped inside the shells and the accessories—such as the straps—are sewn on,Relevant
MadeHow;Bulletproof Vest;30;The finished bulletproof vest is boxed and shipped to the customer,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;1;The manufacturing of candles consists of three steps preparation of the wicking preparation of the wax base and continuous molding or extrusion of the finished candles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;2;The cotton or linen wicks are braided and then treated with chemicals or inorganic salt solutions so that they bend at a 90 degree angle when burning,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;3;This angle allows the end to remain in the outer mantle of the flame and causes it to be shortened naturally,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;4;If the wick is not treated it will burn too quickly and the flame will be extinguished by the melted wax,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;5;However if the wick burns too  slowly then the amount of exposed wick increases and the candle becomes dangerous,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;6;First the wax is heated and melted into a clear nearliquid state in huge metal kettles,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;7;Wax melted by direct flame can become darkcolored or can contain small pieces of carbon char,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;8;Next the molten wax must be carefully filtered to remove impurities that may interfere with the burning process,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;9;Any desired perfumes and dyes are added at this time,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;10;Although most wax arriving at the manufacturer conforms to strict purity standards many companies still filter their wax to be sure of a highquality finished product,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;11;Since the invention of Morgans first candlemaking machine the construction of candles has been performed mainly by continuous molding machines although manual machines are still used by some companies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;12;Continuous molding machines are designed to make candles in groups ranging anywhere from 50 to 500 per load,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;13;The entire process takes almost 30 minutes per load,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;14;Prior to the pouring of the wax the wick is pulled through the tip of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;15;This tip has a hole in it through which the wick passes from a spool located beneath the entire molding machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;16;The molds which are made of tin have polished interior surfaces and are slightly tapered for easier ejection of the finished candle,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;17;The wax is cooled to slightly above its melting point and poured into a molding table located above the molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;18;The wax then works its way into each mold the molds are preheated so the wax will flow evenly into them,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;19;After the wax is poured a jacket around each mold is filled with cold water to speed up the solidification process,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;20;Once the wax has solidified the finished candles are pulled upwards out of the molds allowing the wicks to again thread through the molds in preparation for the next load of candles,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;21;The wicks are snipped and the process begins again,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;22;Excess wax is trimmed collected and reused,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;23;The continuous molding process is used to make cylindrical tapered or fluted candles as long as they can be easily ejected from the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;24;An alternate method uses extrusion a process in which crushed paraffin wax is forced through a heated steel die under extreme pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;25;At the same time the wax is consolidated around the wick,Relevant
MadeHow;Candle ;26;Unlike molding machines extrusion machines produce a continuous length of candle which is then cut into specific sizes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Candle ;27;Next the tips of the candles are formed by rotation cutters and the candles are sent to an automated packing machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;1;A hydrocarbon (such as petroleum oil) and air are fed into a chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;2;Part of the hydrocarbon undergoes incomplete combustion raising the temperature inside the chamber  to 20123092 degrees Fahrenheit (11001700 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;3;At this temperature the unburned hydrocarbon decomposes to carbon black,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;4;The newly created carbon black is routed to a cooler where it is sprayed with water,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;5;The fine black substance is then recovered using a centrifugal cyclone or a bag filter,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;6;A large roll of coating paper (called the mill roll) unwinds and passes over another roll (the dope roll) sitting in a pan of carbon ink,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;7;The ink pan has been heated to between 1688 and 1796 degrees Fahrenheit (76 and 82 degrees Celsius),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;8;As the paper passes over this roll the heated ink is transferred onto one side of the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;9;Next the paper passes over an equalizer rod which scrapes the coated paper to smooth it out and remove excess ink,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;10;The equalizer rod may be either smooth or ridged,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;11;The paper then passes over another roll the chill roll which cools and solidifies the ink onto the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;12;Finally the completed paper is rewound onto another roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;13;In the case of manifold business forms the carbon paper is glued to another form so the paper must have an uncoated strip without carbon where the adhesive can be applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;14;To accomplish this in the Mayer method a strip of metal is simply placed in the proper place on the dope roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;15;This part of the roll thus picks up no ink from the ink pan to pass onto the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;1;Another method called the Flexographic method can also be used to produce onetime carbon paper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;2;First a dope roll is coated with carbon ink from a heated pan below it,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;3;A metering roll contacts the dope roll and  squeezes the ink to a uniform thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;4;The ink is then transferred to a third roll the print roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;5;Meanwhile the paper is fed from a mill roll onto an impression roll that contacts the print roll the third roll mentioned in step #5 above,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;6;When these two rolls come into contact ink from the print roll is passed onto the paper on the impression roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;7;The paper then passes over a chill roll that solidifies the ink before being rolled onto the rewind roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;8;For manifold business forms being produced with the Flexographic method a shallow groove is formed on the print roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;9;Where this groove contacts the paper on the impression roll no ink gets transferred,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;1;The final stage in the manufacture of onetime carbon paper is perforation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;2;First the carbon and the printed forms are slitted while they are being collated,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;3;Next the huge rolls of carbon paper are cut into forms or sheets of the proper size,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;4;If necessary line holes can also be punched into the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;5;All of these operations are carried out automatically by a spot carbonizerprocessing machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carbon Paper;6;Finally the paper is stacked boxed and shipped to the customer,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;1;First wood pulp or cotton seeds are broken down into cellulose fibers through both physical crushing and chemical decomposition,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;2;Next the raw cellulose fibers are treated  with acetic acid and acetic anhydride to create a new compound triacetate,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;3;This material is then treated with a mixture of chemicals and water to produce the basic form of cellulose acetate,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;4;After being heated to remove all moisture the cellulose acetate is mixed with a plasticizing material similar to oil and the resulting cellulose acetate plastic is made into pellets or pelletized,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;5; The pellets are melted into a liquid and spread over a wide flat conveyer belt to form extremely thin plastic sheets—it would take about five such sheets to equal the thickness of common paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;6;The completed backing or film is then wound on large rolls several thousand yards long to await the application of the adhesive,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;7;Modern adhesives differ from their nineteenth century precursors in that adhesomers the synthetic polymers theyre based on are inherently sticky and so require no additional tackifying agents,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;8;Such polymers are made from crude oil distillate that is chemically reacted to form alcohols and acids,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;9;These materials are then mixed with a hydrocarbon solvent that catalyzes their polymerization the process by which they combine to form a complex molecular chain made up of repeating structural sequences,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;10;The resulting adhesomer may be used in this form or redissolved with more coating solvents depending on its intended application,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;11;It is then stored until needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;12;First the nonadhesive side of the backing is treated with a release agent that makes the tape easy to unwind,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;13;Before the adhesive is applied to the sticky side the side may be treated with a primer to anchor the adhesive,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;14;This coating is applied by routing the film over a large roller that rotates in an open vat of primer,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;15;As the tape moves over the roller it applies the primer,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;16;Once these surface coats have been applied the tape travels over heated drums (known as hot cans) that dry it,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;17;A very thin layer of pressure sensitive adhesive is metered onto the primed side of the tape which is then rolled into long ovens for hightemperature drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;18;Once dried the tape is wound onto large jumbo rolls and routed over slicers that divide it into varying widths,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;19;The individual bands of tape are then wound around a small plastic core which is next fitted inside a plastic dispenser whose serrated edge can be used to cut lengths of tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Cellophane Tape;20;Both tape rolls and dispensers come in a variety of sizes to fit varying customer needs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;1;It is important to mix the right amounts together to achieve the desired properties,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;2;Batch calculations are thus required which must take into consideration both physical properties and chemical compositions of the raw materials,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;3;Once the appropriate weight of each raw material is determined the raw materials must be mixed together,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;4;Once the ingredients are weighed they are added together into a shell mixer ribbon mixer or intensive mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;5;A shell mixer consists of two cylinders joined into a V which rotates to tumble and mix the material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;6;A ribbon mixer uses helical vanes and an intensive mixer uses rapidly revolving plows,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;7;This step further grinds the ingredients resulting in a finer particle size that improves the subsequent forming process (see step #4 below),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;8;If wet milling is first used the excess water is usually removed via spray drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;9;This involves pumping the slurry to an atomizer consisting of a rapidly rotating disk or nozzle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;10;Droplets of the slip are dried as they are heated by a rising hot air column forming small free flowing granules that result in a powder suitable for forming,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;11;Most tile is formed by dry pressing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;1;In this method the free flowing powder—containing organic binder or a low percentage of moisture—flows from a hopper into the forming die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;2;The material is compressed in a steel cavity by steel plungers and is then ejected by the bottom plunger,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;3;Automated presses are used with operating pressures as high as 2500 tons,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;4;Ceramic tile usually must be dried (at high relative humidity) after forming especially if a wet method is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;5;Drying which can take several days removes the water at a slow enough rate to prevent shrinkage cracks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;6;Continuous or tunnel driers are used that are heated using gas or oil infrared lamps or microwave energy,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;7;Infrared drying is better suited for thin tile whereas microwave drying works better for thicker tile,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;8;Another method impulse drying uses pulses of hot air flowing in the transverse direction instead of continuously in the material flow direction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;9;To prepare the glaze similar methods are used as for the tile body,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;10;After a batch formulation is calculated the raw materials are weighed mixed and dry or wet milled,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;11;The milled glazes are then applied using one of the many methods available,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;12;In centrifugal glazing or discing the glaze is fed through a rotating disc that flings or throws the glaze onto the tile,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;13;In the bellwaterfall method a stream of glaze falls onto the tile as it passes on a conveyor underneath,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;14;Sometimes the glaze is simply sprayed on,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;15;For multiple glaze applications screen printing on under or between tile that have been wet glazed is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;16;In this process glaze is forced through a screen by a rubber squeegee or other device,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;17;After glazing the tile must be heated intensely to strengthen it and give it the desired porosity,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;18;Two types of ovens or  kilns are used for firing tile,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;19;Wall tile or tile that is prepared by dry grinding instead of wet milling (see #2 and #3 above) usually requires a twostep process,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;20;In this process the tile goes through a lowtemperature firing called bisque firing before glazing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;21;This step removes the volatiles from the material and most or all of the shrinkage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;22;The body and glaze are then fired together in a process called glost firing,Relevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;23;Both firing processes take place in a tunnel or continuous kiln which consists of a chamber through which the ware is slowly moved on a conveyor on refractory batts—shelves built of materials that are resistant to high temperatures—or in containers called saggers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;24;Firing in a tunnel kiln can take two to three days with firing temperatures around 2372 degrees Fahrenheit (1300 degrees Celsius),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ceramic Tile;25;After firing and testing the tile is ready to be packaged and shipped,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;1;Approximately 95 percent of the limestone produced in the United States is quarried,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;2;After a sufficient reserve (twentyfive years worth is recommended) has been prospected the land that covers the deposit is removed with bulldozers and scrapers,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;3;If the chalk is close to the surface an open shelf quarry method can be used however this is very rare,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;4;Usually an open pit quarry method is used instead,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;5;Holes are drilled into the rock explosives are placed inside and the rock is blown apart,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;6;Depending on the nature of the deposit a pit can be enlarged laterally or vertically,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;7;Once comparatively large chunks of limestone have been quarried they need to be transported to crushing machines where they are pulverized to meet the demands of the chalk industry,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;8;The first step is primary crushing,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;9;Various crushers exist but the principle is the same all compress the stone with jaws or a cone or shatter it through impact,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;10;Secondary crushing is accomplished by smaller crushers that work at higher speeds producing pebbles which are then ground and pulverized,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;11;The next phase wet grinding washes away impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;12;It is used to make the fine grade of limestone necessary to make chalk suitable for writing purposes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;13;Wet grinding is carried out in ball mills—rotating steel drums with steel balls inside that pulverize the chalk until it is very fine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;14;Gypsum like limestone is also quarried and pulverized,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;15;The major difference in processing gypsum is that it must be dehydrated to form calcium sulfate the major component of colored chalk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;16;This is done in a kettle a large combustion chamber in which the gypsum is heated to between 244 and 253 degrees Fahrenheit (116121 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;17;It is allowed to boil until it has been reduced by twelve to fifteen percent at which point its water content will have been reduced from 209 percent to between 5 and 6 percent,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;18;To further reduce the water the gypsum is reheated to about 402 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) at which point it is removed from the kettle,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;19;By now almost all of the water has evaporated leaving calcium sulfate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;20;The particles of chalk or calcium sulfate are now conveyed to vibrating screens that sift out the finer material,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;21;The ensuing fine chalk is then washed dried packed in bags and shipped to the manufacturer,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;22;Upon receiving chalk or calcium sulfate the chalk factory usually grinds the materials again to render them smooth and uniformly fine,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;23;To make white classroom chalk the manufacturer adds water to form a thick slurry with the consistency of clay,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;24;The slurry is then placed into and extruded from a die—an orifice of the desired long thin shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;25;Cut into lengths of approximately 2443 inches (62 centimeters) the sticks are next placed on a sheet that contains places for five such sticks,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;26;The sheet is then placed in an oven where the chalk cures for four days at 188 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;27;After it has cured the sticks are cut into 80 millimeters lengths,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;28;Pigments (dry natural colored materials) are mixed in with the calcium carbonate while both are dry (the procedure is similar to sifting flour and baking powder together before adding liquid as in a cake recipe),Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;29;Water is then added to the mixture which is then baked in the same manner as white classroom chalk,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalk Manufacturing;30;Placed in small boxes the completed chalk sticks are stacked in large boxes to be shipped to supply stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;1;Although cheese making is a linear process it involves many factors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;2;Numerous varieties of cheese exist because ending the simple preparation process at different points can produce different cheeses as can varying additives or procedures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;3;Cheese making has long been considered a delicate process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;4;Attempts to duplicate the success of an old cheese factory have been known to fail because conditions at a new factory do not favor the growth of the proper bacteria,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;5;Small cheese factories accept either morning milk (which is richer) evening milk or both,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;6;Because it is generally purchased from small dairies which dont pasteurize this milk contains the bacteria necessary to produce lactic acid one of the agents that triggers curdling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;7;The cheese makers let the milk sit until enough lactic acid has formed to begin producing the particular type of cheese theyre making,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;8;Depending on the type of cheese being produced the cheese makers may then heat the ripening milk,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;9;This process differs slightly at large cheese factories which purchase pasteurized milk and must consequently add a culture of bacteria to produce lactic acid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;10;The next step is to add animal or vegetable rennet to the milk furthering its separation into curds and whey,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;11;Once formed the curds are cut both vertically and horizontally with knives,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;12;In large factories huge vats of curdled milk are cut vertically using sharp multibladed wire knives reminiscent of oven racks,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;13;The same machine then agitates the curds and slices them horizontally,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;14;If the cutting is done manually the curds are cut both ways using a large twohandled knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;15;Soft cheeses are cut into big chunks while hard cheeses are cut into tiny chunks,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;16;(For cheddar for instance the space between the knives is about onetwentieth of an inch [half a centimeter]),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;17;After cutting the curds may be heated to hasten the separation from the whey but they are more typically left alone,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;18;When separation is complete the whey is drained,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;19;Moisture must then be removed from the curds although the amount removed depends on the type of cheese,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;20;For some types with high moisture contents the wheydraining process removes sufficient moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;21;Other types require the curds to be cut heated andor filtered to get rid of excess moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;22;To make cheddar cheese for example cheese makers cheddar or finely chop the curd,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;23;To make hard dry cheeses such as parmesan cheese makers first cheddar and then cook the curd,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;24;Regardless if the curds are to be aged they are then put into molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;25;Here they are pressed to give the proper shape and size,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;26;Soft cheeses such as cottage cheese are not aged,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;27;At this stage the cheese may be inoculated with a flavoring mold bathed in brine or wrapped in cloth or hay before being deposited in a place of the proper temperature and humidity to age,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;28;Some cheeses are aged for a month some for up to several years,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;29;Ageing sharpens the flavor of the cheese for example cheddar aged more than two years is appropriately labeled extra sharp,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;30;Some cheeses may develop a rind naturally as their surfaces dry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;31;Other rinds may form from the growth of bacteria that has been sprayed on the surface of the cheese,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;32;Still other cheeses are washed and this process encourages bacterial growth,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;33;In place of or in addition to rinds cheeses can be sealed in cloth or wax,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;34;For local eating this may be all the packaging that is necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;35;However large quantities of cheese are packaged for sale in distant countries,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;36;Such cheeses may be heavily salted for export (such as Roquefort) or sealed in impermeable plastic or foil,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;37;Edible yet inferior cheeses can be saved and made into processed cheese,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;38;Cheeses such as Emmental (commonly called Swiss) Gruyere (similar to Swiss) Colby or cheddar are cut up and very finely ground,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cheese;39;After this powder has been mixed with water to form a paste other ingredients such as salt fillers emulsifiers preservatives and flavorings are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;40;The mixture is then heated under controlled conditions,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;41;While still warm and soft the cheese paste is extruded into long ribbons that are sliced,Relevant
MadeHow;Cheese;42;The small sheets of cheese are then put onto a plastic or foil sheet and wrapped by a machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;1;While the specific ingredients in gum might be a secret the process for making gum is not,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;2;The first chewing gum making machine wasnt even patented and today the procedure is considered standard throughout the industry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;3;If natural latex is to be used it must first be harvested and processed,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;4;The tall 3279 yard (30meter) chicle tree is scored with a series of shallow Xs enabling the chicle to flow down into a bucket,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;5;After a significant amount of chicle has accumulated it is strained and placed in large kettles,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;6;Stirred constantly it is boiled until it reduces to twothirds of its original volume,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;7;It is then poured into greased wooden molds and shipped,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;8;The natural andor artificial gum bases are first ground into a coarse meal and mixed to ensure uniform consistency,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;9;The blend is then placed in a warm room to dry for a day or two,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;10;During drying hot air continually passes over the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;11;Next the gum base is cooked in kettles at 243 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius) until it has melted into a thick syrup,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;12;To purify it workers pass it through screens and place it in a high speed centrifuge before refiltering it this time through finer screens,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;13;The gum base is now ready for additives,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;14;It is placed in kettles to be cooked and additional ingredients are stirred in by large steel blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;15;First extremely fine powdered sugar and corn syrup are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;16;Flavorings are added next followed by softeners,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;17;When the mixture is smooth enough it is rolled out onto belts and cooled by being exposed to cold air,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;18;The next step is kneading,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;19;For several hours machines gently pummel the mass  of chewing gum until it is properly rubbery and smooth,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;20;Large chunks are then chopped off the mass to be flattened by rollers until they reach the proper thickness of nearly 17 inches (about 43 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;21;During this process the sheet of chewing gum is dusted with powdered sugar to prepare it for cutting,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;22;A cutting machine first scores the sheet in a pattern of rectangles each 13 inches (33 centimeters) long and 449 of an inch (114 centimeters) wide,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;23;The sheet is then put aside at the proper temperature and humidity to season,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;24;Once seasoned the gum sheets are broken into sticks wrapped in aluminum foil or wax paper wrapped in paper and put into plastic packs that are then sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;25;Put into boxes or plastic bags the gum is ready to be shipped to retail outlets,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;26;Amazingly gum balls make up only three percent of chewing gum sales yet their unique merchandising makes them intriguing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;1;Gumballs are made by scoring a cylinder of gum twice to form balls which are then stored several hours at 5560 degrees Fahrenheit (1316 degrees Celsius) to harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;2;The balls are put into huge kettles to be coated with a flavored and colored sucrose solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;3;After seven hours the coated balls are dried with hot air then rolled in beeswax or other wax to make them shiny,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;4;The nature of gumball machines determined the next step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;5;An enclosed plastic globe is subject to interior condensation,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;6;The water collected ruins untreated gumballs so they are usually coated with a plastic waterrepellent glaze to protect them,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;1;Candycoated gums are made in essentially the same way their final destination being boxes not gumball machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;2;A recent development has been the introduction of gums with a liquid center,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;3;To make this gum the gum base is extruded to form a hollow rope,Relevant
MadeHow;Chewing Gum;4;The liquid is then fed into the hollow area and a cutting machine chops the ropes into bitesize pieces and wraps them,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;1;Once a company has received a shipment of cocoa beans at its processing plant the beans are roasted first on screens and then in revolving cylinders through which heated air is blown,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;2;Over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours the moisture in the beans is reduced from about seven percent to about one percent,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;3;The roasting process triggers a browning reaction in which more than 300 different chemicals present in the cocoa beans interact,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;4;The beans now begin to develop the rich flavor we associate with chocolate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;5;Roasting also causes the shells to open and break away from the nibs (the meat of the bean),Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;6;This separation process can be completed by blowing air across the beans as they go through a giant winnowing machine called a cracker and fanner which loosens the hulls from the beans without crushing them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;7;The hulls now separated from the nibs are usually sold as either mulch or fertilizer,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;8;They are also sometimes used as a commercial boiler fuel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;9;Next the roasted nibs undergo broyage a process of crushing that takes place in a grinder made of revolving granite blocks,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;10;The design of the grinder may vary but most resemble oldfashioned flour mills,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;11;The final product of this grinding process made up of small particles of the nib suspended in oil is a thick syrup known as chocolate liquor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;12;The next step is refining during which the liquor is further ground between sets of revolving metal drums,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;13;Each successive rolling is faster than the preceding one because the liquor is becoming smoother and flows easier,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;14;The ultimate goal is to reduce the size of the particles in the liquor to about 001 inch (00254 centimeters),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;15;If the chocolate being produced is to be cocoa powder from which hot chocolate and baking mixes are made the chocolate liquor may be dutched a process sonamed because it was invented by the Dutch chocolate maker Conrad van Houten,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;16;In the dutching process the liquor is treated with an alkaline solution usually potassium carbonate that raises its pH from 55 to 7 or 8,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;17;This increase darkens the color of the cocoa renders its flavor more mild and reduces the tendency of the nib particles to form clumps in the liquor,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;18;The powder that eventually ensues is called dutch cocoa,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;19;The next step in making cocoa powder is defatting the chocolate liquor or removing large amounts of butter from it,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;20;This is done by further compressing the liquor between rollers until about half of the fat from its cocoa beans has been released,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;21;The resulting solid material commonly called press cake is then broken chopped or crushed before being sifted to produce cocoa powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;22;When additives such as sugar or other sweeteners have been blended this cocoa powder becomes a modern version of chocalatl,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;23;If the chocolate being produced is to become candy the press cake is remixed with some of the removed cocoa butter,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;24;The restored cocoa butter is necessary for texture and consistency and different types of chocolate require different amounts of cocoa butter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;25;The mixture now undergoes a process known as conching in which it is continuously turned and ground in a huge open vat,Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;26;The processs name derives from older vats which resembled large conch shells,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;27;The conching process can last from between three hours to three days (more time is not necessarily better however),Relevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;28;This is the most important step in making chocolate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;29;The speed and temperature of the mixing are critical in determining the quality of the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;30;Another crucial aspect of conching is the time and rate at which other ingredients are added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;31;The ingredients added during conching determine what type of chocolate is produced sweet chocolate consists of chocolate liquor cocoa butter sugar and vanilla milk chocolate contains sweet chocolate with powdered whole milk or whole liquid milk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chocolate;32;At the end of the conching process the chocolate is poured into molds cooled cut and wrapped,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;1;First the coffee cherries must be harvested a process that is still done manually,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;2;Next the cherries are dried and husked using one of two methods,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;3;The dry method is an older primitive and laborintensive process of distributing the cherries in the sun raking them several times a day and allowing them to dry,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;4;When they have dried to the point at which they contain only 12 percent water the beans husks become shriveled,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;5;At this stage they are hulled either by hand or by a machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;6;In employing the wet method the hulls are removed before the beans have dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;7;Although the fruit is initially processed in a pulping machine that removes most of the material surrounding the beans some of this glutinous covering remains after pulping,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;8;This residue is removed by letting the beans ferment in tanks where their natural enzymes digest the gluey substance over a period of 18 to 36 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;9;Upon removal from the fermenting tank the beans are washed dried by exposure to hot air and put into large mechanical stirrers called hullers,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;10; There the beans last parchment covering the pergamino crumbles and falls away easily,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;11;The huller then polishes the bean to a clean glossy finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;12;The beans are then placed on a conveyor belt that carries them past workers who remove sticks and other debris,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;13;Next they are graded according to size the location and altitude of the plantation where they were grown drying and husking methods and taste,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;14;All these factors contribute to certain flavors that consumers will be able to select thanks in part to the grade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;15;Once these processes are completed workers select and pack particular types and grades of beans to fill orders from the various roasting companies that will finish preparing the beans,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;16;When beans (usually robusta) are harvested under the undesirable conditions of hot humid countries or coastal regions they must be shipped as quickly as possible because such climates encourage insects and fungi that can severely damage a shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;17;When the coffee beans arrive at a roasting plant they are again cleaned and sorted by mechanical screening devices to remove leaves bark and other remaining debris,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;18;If the beans are not to be decaffeinated they are ready for roasting,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;19;If the coffee is to be decaffeinated it is now processed using either a solvent or a water method,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;20;In the first process the coffee beans are treated with a solvent (usually methylene chloride) that leaches out the caffeine,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;21;If this decaffeination method is used the beans must be thoroughly washed to remove traces of the solvent prior to roasting,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;22;The other method entails steaming the beans to bring the caffeine to the surface and then scraping off this caffeinerich layer,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;23;The beans are roasted in huge commercial roasters according to procedures and specifications which vary among manufacturers (specialty shops usually purchase beans directly from the growers and roast them onsite),Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;24;The most common process entails placing the beans in a large metal cylinder and blowing hot air into it,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;25;An older method called singeing calls for placing the beans in a metal cylinder that is then rotated over an electric gas or charcoal heater,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;26;Regardless of the particular method used roasting gradually raises the temperature of the beans to between 431 and 449 degrees Fahrenheit (220230 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;27;This triggers the release of steam carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and other volatiles reducing the weight of the beans by 14 to 23 percent,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;28;The pressure of these escaping internal gases causes the beans to swell and they increase their volume by 30 to 100 percent,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;29;Roasting also darkens the color of the beans gives them a crumbly texture and triggers the chemical reactions that imbue the coffee with its familiar aroma (which it has not heretofore possessed),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;30;After leaving the roaster the beans are placed in a cooling vat wherein they are stirred while cold air is blown over them,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;31;If the coffee being prepared is highquality the cooled beans will now be sent through an electronic sorter equipped to detect and eliminate beans that emerged from the roasting process too light or too dark,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;32;If the coffee is to be preground the manufacturer mills it immediately after roasting,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;33;Special types of grinding have been developed for each of the different types of coffee makers as each functions best with coffee ground to a specific fineness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;34;If the coffee is to be instant it is I V brewed with water in huge percolators after the grinding stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;35;An extract is clarified from the brewed coffee and sprayed into a large cylinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;36;As it falls downward through this cylinder it enters a warm air stream that converts it into a dry powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;37;Because it is less vulnerable to flavor and aroma loss than other types of coffee whole bean coffee is usually packaged in foillined bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;38;If it is to retain its aromatic qualities preground coffee must be hermetically sealed it is usually packaged in impermeable plastic film aluminum foil or cans,Relevant
MadeHow;Coffee ;39;Instant coffee picks up moisture easily so it is vacuumpacked in tin cans or glass jars before being shipped to retail stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;1;The twenty component parts of the typical combination lock are formed drawn cut pressed and molded on a variety of machines both manual and automatic,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;2;The lever locking latch and disc shaft are all made by injection molding a process in which molten zamak is poured into a mold and subjected to heat and pressure until it solidifies into the shape of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;3;Although the post is shaped at room temperature it is also formed under high pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;4;The combination disc and the cam are made of coldrolled—passed under huge rolls without being heated—flat strip steel after being cold rolled the steel is put in a blanking die a sophisticated cookie cutter which cuts (or blanks) out the properly shaped piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;5;The internal disc spring is made from stainless steel round wire and produced on a spring winder that automatically twists and turns the wire to form the traditional coil spring,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;6;The shackle collar like the combination disc and cam is made from coldrolled flat strip steel that is blanked in a blanking die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;7;The inner case is produced from flat steel strip and drawn to a cup configuration,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;8;This process requires great pressure to stretch and compress the material as it is pressed or drawn around a die whose shape it takes,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;9;The outer case is manufactured similarly to the inner case but from stainless steel sheet instead of strip,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;10;The back cover also stainless steel is blanked in a blanking die,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;11;The durable shackle is made of round bar stock and machined on a screw machine then formed to its Ushape and notched to accept the locking latch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;12;It is finally annealed (heated to great temperature before being quenched in water) to make it resistant to hacksaws and bolt cutters,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;13;The combination dial also zamak is injection molded then chromized,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;14;This process involves heating the part in a salt bath rich in chromium,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;15;The steel absorbs the chromium which hardens on the surface as it cools rapidly,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;16;The dial is painted black and white wiped which leaves the numbers highlighted against the black face,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;17;Several plating and finishing processes can be used to protect the components against corrosion,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;18;The lever disc shaft combination cam and dial are chromized,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;19;The inner case shackle collar and lever post are all cadmiumplated,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;20;The shackle and locking latch are copper nickelplated,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;21;The outer case of stainless steel is mechanically polished to enhance luster,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;22;Assembly of the components is precise with the back plate disc shaft combination cam and spacers forming one subassembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;23;The outer and inner cases are riveted together and then pierced at the point where the shackle is inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;24;The combination dial outer and inner case unit and combination cam are then fastened together,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;25;Finally these subassemblies and the remaining parts are fitted together,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;26;The lock case is closed and the edges folded over and sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;27;Conventional hardware fasteners that can be released with the proper tool are not used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;28;The remaining operation is the application of a removable tag or label to the lock,Relevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;29;On this tag is the combination determined randomly by machine draw,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;30;Lock manufacturers today jealously guard their combination setting procedures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combination Lock;31;A typical combination lock is sold in blister pack a rigid molded plastic with cardboard backing although locks may also be individually boxed,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;1;Manufacturing a combine begins with the delivery of large coils of sheet steel to the sheet metal shop,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;2;The coil steel is loaded into one of several machines that make up the cuttolength line in the sheet metal shop,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;3;Computercontrolled rollers pull the steel from the coil flatten it and feed it into a cutting machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;4;The steel is cut into blanks basic rectangular shapes that are later welded together to form the body of the combine and the topmounted grain tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;5;For maximum efficiency the cuttolength line operates on predetermined batch schedules,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;6;The basic metal shapes cut from the steel coils are used during the day or week that they are cut so there is no storage of basic components,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;7;From the cuttolength line the blanks are moved to the cuttoshape line,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;8;In a laser punch press an industrial laser cuts complex shapes from them and drills holes for shafts piping and bolts,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;9;Then the press exerts up to 1000 tons of pressure to bend the steel into final form,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;10;Small batches of parts are moved from the sheet metal shop to the welding area where cellular manufacturing techniques are used for speed and quality control,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;11;In cellular manufacturing several manufacturing functions are grouped in one area so parts can be quickly passed from one operation to the next and several subcomponents are loaded on a transportation skid before being sent to the next assembly step,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;12;Thus all the parts needed to assemble a batch of components are present when the skid arrives,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;13;To further enhance efficiency much of the welding of sheet steel components is done by powerful computercontrolled units,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;14;Hydraulic lifts properly position components that are then welded by onearmed robots,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;15;As the smaller components of the combine are assembled the body begins to take shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;16;  In the form of a simple frame it is now attached to an overhead loadbar conveyor track that carries it through the remainder of the production process,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;17;After the body has been welded the overhead conveyor transports it to and submerges it in the paint tank a huge 48000 gallon (181776 liters) tank full of electrostatically charged paint,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;18;Because combines are used and stored outside their paint must be able to resist the harmful effects of sunshine and moisture and the electrostatic process insures that it will,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combine;19;In electrostatic painting the metal combine body is given a positive electrical charge while the waterbased paint is given a negative charge,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;20;Because opposite electrical charges are attracted to each other the positively charged body attracts the negatively charged paint causing the paint to bond to the combine tightly and completely (only rubber gaskets and other nonmetallic parts are not touched by the paint),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combine;21;After the conveyor lifts the combine body from the paint bath it suspends it over the tank for a few moments so that excess paint can drip off,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;22;The body is then moved into a 363 degree Fahrenheit (182 degrees Celsius) oven where the paint is baked to a hard rustresistant finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;23;After painting the combine body is carried through the assembly line so that other major components may be installed,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;24;Where necessary these components have also been dipped in the electrostatic paint bath,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;25;Once the axles hubs and tires have been added the combine is removed from the overhead conveyor and is towed from station to station,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;26;After the combine body the other significant structural assembly is the grain tank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combine;27;In the grain tank assembly area skilled workers use a complex positioning and welding system to complete more than 500 separate welds in two 10Y2 minute sequences,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combine;28;Automated sheet metal handling equipment pulls flat sheets from skids fresh from the cuttoshape line in the sheet metal shop,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Combine;29;These sheets are then loaded onto a huge metal table the size of a twocar garage,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;30;Next hydraulic cylinders position the side panels as human welders scramble to secure the corners of the grain tank with tack welds,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;31;When the human welders are out of harms way robot arms swing into action making hundreds of welds in a few minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;32;After the body and grain tank have been painted they are brought to the final assembly line where 22 different assembly operations are performed,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;33;Major components like the engine module are installed wiring and hydraulic lines are connected and all systems are tested,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;34;Oil antifreeze and gas are added and the engine is started,Relevant
MadeHow;Combine;35;On the outside a final coating of clear polyurethane is applied across the top of the wide flat surfaces of the cab grain tank and engine module and decals are applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;1;Compact discs must be manufactured under very clean and dust free conditions in a clean room which is kept free from virtually all dust particles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;2;The air in the room is specially filtered to keep out dirt and occupants of the room must wear special clothing,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;3;Because an average dust particle is 100 times larger than the average pit and land on a CD even the smallest dust particle can render a disc useless,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;4;The original music is first recorded onto a digital audio tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;5;Next the audio program is transferred to a 34inch (19 centimeters) video tape and then data (called subcodes) used for indexing and tracking the music is added to the audio data on the tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;6;At this point the tape is called a premaster,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;7;The premaster tape will be used to create the disc master (also called the glass master) which is a disc made from specially prepared glass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;8;The glass is polished to a smooth finish and coated with a layer of adhesive and a layer of photoresist material,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;9;The disc is approximately 945 inches (240 millimeters) in diameter and 24 of an inch (six millimeters) thick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;10;After the adhesive and photoresist are applied the disc is cured in an oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;11;Next both the premaster tape and the disc master are put into a complex laser cutting machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;12;The machine plays back the audio program on the premaster tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;13;As it does so the program is transferred to a device called a CD encoder which in turn generates an electrical signal,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;14;This signal powers a laser beam which exposes or cuts grooves into the photoresist coating on the glass disc (the disc master),Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;15;The grooves that have been exposed are then etched away by chemicals these etched grooves will form the pits of the CDs surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;16;A metal coating usually silver is then applied to the disc,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;17;The disc master now contains the exact pitandland track that the finished CD will have,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;18;After etching the disc master undergoes a process called electroforming in which another metal layer such as nickel is deposited onto the discs surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;19;The phrase electro is used because the metal is deposited using an electric current,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;20;The disc is bathed in an electrolytic solution such as nickel solphamate and as the electric current is applied a layer of metal forms on the disc master,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;21;The thickness of this metal layer is strictly controlled,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;22;Next the newly applied metal layer is pulled apart from the disc master which is put aside,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;23;The metal layer or father contains a negative impression of the disc master track in other words the track on the metal layer is an exact replica but in reverse of the track on the disc master,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;24;The metal father then undergoes further electroforming to produce one or more mothers which are simply metal layers that again have positive impressions of the original disc master track,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;25;Using the same electroforming process each mother then produces a son (also called a stamper) with a negative impression of the track,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;26;It is the son that is then used to create the actual CD,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;27;After being separated from the mother the metal son is rinsed dried polished and put in a punching machine that cuts out the center hole and forms the desired outside diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;28;The metal son is then put into a hollow cavity—a die—of the proper disc shape in an injection molding machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;29;Molten polycarbonate plastic is then poured into this die to form around the metal son,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;30;Once cooled the plastic is shaped like the son with the pits and grooves—once again in a positive impression of the original disc master track—formed into one side,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;31;The center hole is then punched out of plastic disc which is transparent at  this stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;32;Next the disc is scanned for flaws such as water bubbles dust particles and warps,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;33;If a flaw is found the disc must be discarded,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;34;If the disc meets the quality standards I it is then coated with an extremely thin reflective layer of aluminum,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;35;The coating is applied using vacuum deposition,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;36;In this process aluminum is put into a vacuum chamber and heated to the point of evaporation which allows it to be applied evenly to the plastic disc,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;37;Finally a clear acrylic plastic is applied to the disc to help protect the underlying layers from physical damage such as scratches,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc;38;After the label is printed generally using a silkscreening process the compact disc is complete and ready for packaging and shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;1;Purchased from outside contractors the laser and the photodiode are installed beneath the disc clamp,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;2;The various lenses and mirrors in the assembly must be properly spaced and aligned so that they can focus and direct light as necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;3;The whole assembly is then housed in a plastic case,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;4;The case is made by the one of the usual plastic forming processes such as extrusion or injection molding while the lenses and mirrors (usually silicon) are cut into the proper shape and then finely polished with abrasives,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;5;The semiconducting photodiode is made by preparing and polishing a substance such as silicon or germanium and then adding impurities to create layers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;6;Electrical contacts are then added,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;7;After the optical components are in position the gears and belt that will help to position the optical pickup are put in place,Relevant

MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;12;Designed by engineers using computeraided design (CAD) packages the circuit boards consist of a copperclad base that has a pattern transferred onto it (masking) through screen printing or a similar method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;13;After being coated with a photosensitive material the patterned areas are etched away chemically to create a multilayered board—the layers comprise the various transistors and capacitors that make up the circuits,Relevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;14;The tiny microchips (usually made of silicon) that are mounted on the board are made in the same way except on a much smaller scale,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Compact Disc Player;15;Depending on the manufacturer the CD player may have one large circuit board or several smaller boards,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Concrete;1;The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;2;First the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;3;Next the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel) admixtures (chemical additives) any necessary fibers and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;4;The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed compacted and cured,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;5;The limestone silica and alumina that make up Portland cement are dry ground into a very fine powder mixed together in predetermined proportions preheated and calcined (heated to a high temperature that will burn off impurities without fusing the ingredients),Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;6;Next the material is burned in a large rotary kiln at 2550 degrees Fahrenheit (1400 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;7;At this temperature the material partially fuses into a substance known as clinker,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;8;A modern kiln can produce as much as 6200 tons of clinker a day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;9;The clinker is then cooled and ground to a fine powder in a tube or ball mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;10;A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;11;Gypsum is added during the grinding process,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;12;The final composition consists of several compounds tricalcium silicate dicalcium silicate tricalcium aluminate and tetracalcium aluminoferrite,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;13;The cement is then mixed with the other ingredients aggregates (sand gravel or crushed stone) admixtures fibers and water,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;14;Aggregates are preblended or added at the readymix concrete plant under normal operating conditions,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;15;The mixing operation uses rotation or stirring to coat the surface of the aggregate with cement paste and to blend the other ingredients uniformly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;16;A variety of batch or continuous mixers are used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;17;Fibers if desired can be added by a variety of methods including direct spraying premixing impregnating or hand layingup,Relevant

MadeHow;Concrete;23;A vacuum provides a continuous flow of concrete with two rotating rollers squeezing a flexible pipe to move the concrete into the delivery pipe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;24;Once at the site the concrete must be placed and compacted,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;25;These two operations are performed almost simultaneously,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;26;Placing must be done so that segregation of the various ingredients is avoided and full compaction—with all air bubbles eliminated—can be achieved,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;27;Whether chutes or buggies are used position is important in achieving these goals,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;28;The rates of placing and of compaction should be equal the latter is usually accomplished using internal or external vibrators,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;29;An internal vibrator uses a poker housing a motordriven shaft,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;30;When the poker is inserted into the concrete controlled vibration occurs to compact the concrete,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;31;External vibrators are used for precast or thin in situ sections having a shape or thickness unsuitable for internal vibrators,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;32;These type of vibrators are rigidly clamped to the formwork which rests on an elastic support,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;33;Both the form and the concrete are vibrated,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;34;Vibrating tables are also used where a table produces vertical vibration by using two shafts rotating in opposite directions,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;35;Once it is placed and compacted the concrete must cured before it is finished to make sure that it doesnt dry too quickly,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete;36;Concretes strength is influenced by its moisture level during the hardening process as the cement solidifies the concrete shrinks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;37;If site constraints prevent the concrete from contracting tensile stresses will develop weakening the concrete,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete;38;To minimize this problem concrete must be kept damp during the several days it requires to set and harden,Relevant

MadeHow;Cooking Oil;2;In the case of cotton the ginned seeds must be stripped of their lint as well as dehulled,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;3;In the case of corn the kernel must undergo milling to separate the germ,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;4;The stripped seeds or nuts are then ground into coarse meal to provide more surface area to be pressed,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;5;Mechanized grooved rollers or hammer mills crush the material to the proper consistency,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;6;The meal is then heated to facilitate the extraction of the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;7;While the procedure allows more oil to be pressed out more impurities are also pressed out with the oil and these must be removed before the oil can be deemed edible,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;8;The heated meal is then fed continuously into a screw press which increases the pressure progressively as the meal passes through a slotted barrel,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;9;Pressure generally increases from 68950 to 206850 kilopascals as the oil is squeezed out from the slots in the barrel where it can be recovered,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;10;Soybeans are usually not pressed at all before solvent extraction because they have relatively little oil but most oil seeds with more oil are pressed and solventtreated,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;11;After the initial oil has been recovered from the screw press the oil cake remaining in the press is processed by solvent extraction to attain the maximum yield,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;12;A volatile hydrocarbon (most commonly hexane) dissolves the oil out of the oil cake which is then recovered by distilling the light solvent out,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;13;The BlawKnox Rotocell is used to meet the demands of the United States soybean oil industry,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;14;In using this machine flakes of meal are sent through wedgeshaped cells of a cylindrical vessel,Relevant

MadeHow;Cooking Oil;16;Also still in use by a significant number of manufacturers is the Bollman or HansaMuhle unit in which oilseed flakes are placed in perforated baskets that circulate continuously,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;17;The solvent percolates through the matter which is periodically dumped and replaced,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;18;Ninety percent of the solvent remaining in the extracted oil simply evaporates and as it does it is collected for reuse,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;19;The rest is retrieved with the use of a stripping column,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;20;The oil is boiled by steam and the lighter hexane floats upward,Relevant

MadeHow;Cooking Oil;22;The oil is next refined to remove color odor and bitterness,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;23;Refining consists of heating the oil to between 107 and 188 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 85 degrees Celsius) and mixing an alkaline substance such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate with it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;24;Soap forms from the undesired fatty acids and the alkaline additive and it is usually removed by centrifuge,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;25;The oil is further washed to remove traces of soap and then dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;26;Oils are also degummed at this time by treating them with water heated to between 188 and 206 degrees Fahrenheit (85 and 95 degrees Celsius) steam or water with acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;27;The gums most of which are phosphatides precipitate out and the dregs are removed by centrifuge,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;28;Oil that will be heated (for use in cooking) is then bleached by filtering it through fullers earth activated carbon or activated clays that absorb certain pigmented material from the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;29;By contrast oil that will undergo refrigeration (because it is intended for salad dressing for example) is winterized—rapidly chilled and filtered to remove waxes,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;30;This procedure ensures that the oil will not partially solidify in the refrigerator,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;31;Finally the oil is deodorized,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;32;In this process steam is passed over hot oil in a vacuum at between 440 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit (225 and 250 degrees Celsius) thus allowing the volatile taste and odor components to distill from the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Cooking Oil;33;Typically citric acid at 01 percent is also added to oil after deodorization to inactivate trace metals that might promote oxidation within the oil and hence shorten its shelflife,Relevant

MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;21;One roll of cardboard is corrugated and then glued between two other layers (liners) by the same machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;22;The glue is then cured by passing the cardboard over heated rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;28;One roll of medium is loaded to run through the corrugating rolls and a roll of liner is fed into the corrugator to be joined with the corrugated medium,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;29;Liner from another roll travels up over the corrugating rolls along a flat structure called the bridge,Relevant

MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;31;For a large production run additional rolls are loaded into automatic splicers,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;32;Sensitive detectors check the rolls of paper feeding into the corrugator,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;33;When a roll is nearly empty the corrugator control system starts a splicer and paper from the new roll is joined to the end of the paper going through the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;34;Thus production of corrugated cardboard is continuous and no production speed is lost,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;35;The medium to be corrugated is fed into the giant electrically driven rollers of the corrugator first through the preheating rollers and then into the corrugating rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;36;Steam at 175 to 180 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) is forced through both sets of rollers and as the paper passes through them temperatures reach 350 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit (177 to 185 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;37;The corrugating rolls are covered with I O flutes —horizontal parallel ridges like the teeth of massively wide gears,Relevant

MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;46;Continuing through the corrugator the cardboard passes over steamheated plates that cure the glue,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;47;At the end of corrugator a slitterscorer trims the cardboard and cuts it into large sheets called box blanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;48;Box blanks pop out of the slitterscorer like wide slices of toast and slide into an automatic stacker that loads them onto a large rolling platform,Relevant
MadeHow;Corrugated Cardboard;49;From here they will be transported to the other machines that will convert them into finished containers,Relevant

MadeHow;Cutlery;9;The annealing done under great heat must be very accurately controlled so the final piece will be resistant to bending and to nicks and dents when in use,Relevant
MadeHow;Cutlery;10;The last annealing is the most  important because the pieces must be just the right degree of hardness when they are embossed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cutlery;11;Then the metal can be forced easily into all the tiny details in the dies and the ornamentation will be faithfully reproduced,Relevant
MadeHow;Cutlery;12;The rolled blanks are placed in the cutout press by an operator to remove the excess metal and to fashion the shape of the piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Cutlery;13;This process is similar to cutting shapes from rolled dough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cutlery;14;The shape of the piece is cut out of the metal and the excess metal is remelted and transformed back into sheets of metal to be used again,Relevant

MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);8;The beads are then fed into a mold of the desired shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);9;The basic unit of polystyrene is styrene which is the product of a twofold reaction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);10;Ethylene and benzene in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminum chloride form ethylbenzene (C 8 H 8 ) which is then dehydrogenated (hydrogen is removed) at 11121202 degrees Fahrenheit (600650 degrees Celsius) to form styrene (C 8 H 8 ),Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);11;Polystyrene is formed from styrene through suspension polymerization a process by which tiny drops of the monomer (in this case styrene) are completely surrounded by water and a mucilaginous substance,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);12;Supporting and surrounding the styrene globules the suspension agent produces uniform droplets of polystyrene,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);13;Next a polymerization initiator is added to the droplets which are suspended by heat radiation of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);14;This results in free radicals a group of atoms particularly likely to react with others because they contain unpaired electrons which are available for molecular bonding,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);17;Terminators are introduced to the process to end it at the appropriate time,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);18;Though variable chain length must fall within a certain range because polystyrene with overly long chains wont melt readily and polystyrene with short chains will be brittle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);19;After polymerization is complete the mixture—consisting of beads made up of polystyrene chains—is cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);20;These beads are then washed out and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);21;Uniform bead size is achieved by sorting the beads through meshes which filter out over and undersized beads,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);22;First the beads of polystyrene must be expanded to achieve the proper density,Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);23;This process is known as preexpansion and involves heating the polystyrene either with steam (the most common method) or hot air (for high density foam such as that used for a coffee cup) the heating is carried out in a vessel holding anywhere from 50 to 500 gallons (189 to 1892 liters),Relevant
MadeHow;Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF);24;During preexpansion an agitator is used to keep the beads from fusing together,Relevant

MadeHow;Golf Cart;52;Overseas shipments require that the golf cart be placed on a skid—a heavy wood or steel rack—to discourage shifting in transit,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;1;Most grinding wheels are manufactured by the coldpress method in which a mixture of components is pressed into shape at room temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;2;The details of processes vary considerably depending upon the type of wheel and the practices of individual companies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;3;For mass production of small wheels many portions of the process are automated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;4;Preparing the grinding wheel mixture begins with selecting precise quantities of abrasives bond materials and additives according to a specific formula,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;5;A binder typically a waterbased wetting agent in the case of vitrified wheels is added to coat the abrasive grains this coating improves the grains adhesion to the binder,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;6;The binder also helps the grinding wheel retain its shape until the bond is solidified,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;7;Some manufacturers simply mix all materials in a single mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;8;Others use separate steps to mix abrasive grains with binder,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;9;Wheel manufacturers often spend considerable effort to develop a satisfactory mixture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;10;The blend must be freeflowing and distribute grain evenly throughout the structure of the grinding wheel to assure uniform cutting action and minimal vibration as the wheel rotates during use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;11;This is particularly important for large wheels which may be as big as several feet in diameter or for wheels that have a shape other than the familiar flat disk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;12;For the most common type of wheel an annular disc a predetermined amount of grinding wheel mixture is poured into a mold consisting of four pieces a circular pin the size of the finished wheels arbor hole (its center hole) a shell with a 1inch (25centimeter) wall about twice as high as the desired grinding wheel is thick and two flat  circular plates with diameter and arbor hole sizes equal to those of the wheel,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;13;A variety of methods are used to distribute the mixture evenly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;14;Typically a straight edge pivots about the center arbor pin to spread the mixture throughout the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;15;Using pressures in the range of 100 to 5000 pounds per square inch (psi) for 10 to 30 seconds a hydraulic press then compacts the mixture into the grinding wheels final shape,Relevant

MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;19;Final shaping of the wheel may take place at this time,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;20;All work at this stage has to be done very carefully because the wheel is held together by only the temporary binder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;21;Lighter wheels can be lifted by hand at this stage heavier ones may be lifted with a hoist or carefully slid on a carrier to be transported to the kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;22;Generally the purposes of the firing are to melt the binder around the abrasives and to convert it to a form that will resist the heat and solvents encountered during grinding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;23;A wide range of furnaces and kilns are used to fire grinding wheels and the temperatures vary widely depending upon the type of bond,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Grinding Wheel;24;Wheels with a resin bond are typically fired at a temperature of 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (149 to 204 degrees Celsius) and wheels with vitrified bonds are fired to temperatures between 1700 and 2300 degrees Fahrenheit (927 to 1260 degrees Celsius),Irrelevant

MadeHow;Guitare;1;The first and most important step in guitar construction is wood selection,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;2;The choice of wood will directly affect the sound quality of the finished product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;3;The wood must be free of flaws and have a straight vertical grain,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;4;Since each section of the guitar uses different types of woods the construction process varies from section to section,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;5;Following is a description of the manufacture of a typical acoustic guitar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;6;The wood for the top of the guitar is cut from lumber using a process called bookmatching,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;7;Bookmatching is a method by which a single piece of wood is sliced into two sheets each the same length and width as the original but only half as thick,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;8;This gives the sheets a symmetrical grain pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;9;The two sheets are matched to ensure continuity in the grains and glued together,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;10;Once dry the newly joined boards are sanded to the proper thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;11;They are closely inspected for quality and then graded according to color closeness and regularity of grain and lack of blemishes,Relevant

MadeHow;Guitare;13;The soundhole is sawed with slots carved around it for concentric circles that serve as decorative inlays around the soundhole,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;14;Wood braces are next glued to the underside of the top piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;15;Strutting as this process is often called serves two purposes brace the wood against the pull of the strings and control the way the top vibrates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;16;An area of guitar construction that differs from company to company strutting has a great affect on the guitars tone,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;17;Many braces today are glued in an Xpattern originally designed by the Martin Company a pattern that most experts feel provides the truest acoustics and tone,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;18;Although companies such as Ovation and Gibson continue to experiment with improvements on the Xpattern style of strutting Martins original concept is widely accepted as producing the best sound,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Guitare;21;The back is cut and glued similar to the top—and from the same piece of lumber as the top to ensure matching grains—using the bookinatch technique,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;22;Construction of the sides consists of cutting and sanding the strips of wood to the proper length and thickness and then softening the wood in water,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;23;The strips are then placed in molds that are shaped to the curves of the guitar and the entire assembly is clamped for a period of time to ensure symmetry between the two sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;24;The two sides are joined together with basswood glued to the inside walls,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;25;Strips of reinforcing wood are placed along the inner sides so that the guitar doesnt crack if hit from the side,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;26;Two endblocks (near the neck and near the bottom of the guitar) are also used to join the top back and neck,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;27;Once the sides are joined and the endblocks are in place the top and the back are glued to the sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;28;The excess wood is trimmed off and slots are cut along the sidetop and sideback junctions,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;29;These slots are for the body bindings that cover the guitars sides,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;30;The bindings are not only decorative they also keep moisture from entering through the sides and warping the guitar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;31;The neck is made from one piece of hard wood typically mahogany or rosewood carved to exact specifications,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;32;A reinforcing rod is inserted through the length of the neck and after sanding the fingerboard (often made of ebony or rosewood) is set in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;33;Using precise measurements fret slots are cut into the fingerboard and the steelwired frets are put in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;34;Once the neck construction is completed it is attached to the body,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;35;Most guitar companies attach the neck and the body by fitting a heel that extends from the base of the neck into a precut groove on the body,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;36;Once the glue has dried at the neckbody junction the entire guitar receives a coat of sealer and then several coats of lacquer,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;37;On some models intricate decorations or inlays are also placed on the guitar top,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;38;After polishing a bridge is attached near the bottom of the guitar below the soundhole and a saddle is fitted,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;39;The saddle is where the strings actually lie as they pass over the bridge and it is extremely important in the transferring of string vibration to the guitar top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;40;On the opposite end of the guitar the nut is placed between the neck and the head,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;41;The nut is a strip of wood or plastic on which the strings lie as they pass to the head and into the tuning machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;42;The tuning machine is next fitted to the guitar head,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;43;This machine is one of the most delicate parts of the guitar and is usually mounted on the back of the head,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Guitare;44;The pegs that hold each string poke through to the front and the gears that turn both the pegs and the stringtightening keys are housed in metal casings,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;45;Finally the guitar is strung and inspected before leaving the factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Guitare;46;The entire process of making a guitar can take between three weeks and two months depending on the amount of decorative detail work on the guitar top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;1;Each individual tubular part is cut by a tube cutting machine that can be quickly set to produce different precise lengths and specified batch quantities,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;2;Tubing requiring angular bends is shaped to the proper angle in a bending machine that utilizes interchangeable tools for different diameters and sizes,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;3;For other than minor bends tubes are filled with molten sodium silicate that hardens and eliminates kinking by causing the tube to bend as a solid bar,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Helicopter;11;When the template has been formed it is dipped in molten metal as many times as necessary to achieve the thickness desired,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;12;When the part has dried it is heated so that the wax or alloy will melt and can be poured out,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;13;Heated to a higher temperature to purify it and placed in a mold box where it is supported by sand the mold is then ready to shape molten metal into reinforcement parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;14;After removal and cooling these parts are then finishmachined by standard methods before being deburred once again,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;15;The tubes are chemically cleaned fitted into a subassembly fixture and MIG (metalarc inert gas) welded,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;16;In this process a small electrode wire is fed through a welding torch and an inert shielding gas (usually argon or helium) is passed through a nozzle around it the tubes are joined by the melting of the wire,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;17;After welding the subassembly is stress relieved—heated to a low temperature so that the metal can recover any elasticity it has lost during the shaping process,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;18;Finally the welds are inspected for flaws,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;19;Sheet metal which makes up other parts of the airframe is first cut into blanks (pieces cut to predetermined size in preparation for subsequent work) by abrasive waterjet blanking dies or routing,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;20;Aluminum blanks are heattreated to anneal them (give them a uniform strainfree structure that will increase their malleability),Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;21;The blanks are then refrigerated until they are placed in dies where they will be pressed into the proper shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;22;After forming the sheet metal details are aged to full strength and trimmed by routing to final shape and size,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;23;Sheet metal parts are cleaned before being assembled by riveting or adhesive bonding,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;24;Aluminum parts and welded subassemblies may be anodized (treated to thicken the protective oxide film on the surface of the aluminum) which increases corrosion resistance,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;25;All metal parts are chemically cleaned and primerpainted and most receive finish paint by spraying with epoxy or other durable coating,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;26;Cores the central parts of the composite components are made of Nomex (a brand of aramid produced by Du Pont) or aluminum honeycomb which is cut to size by bandsaw or reciprocating knife,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;27;If necessary the cores then have their edges trimmed and beveled by a machine tool similar to a pizza cutter or meat slicing blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;28;The material with which each component is built up from its cores (each component may use multiple cores) is called prepreg ply,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;29; The plies are layers of oriented fibers usually epoxy or polyimide that have been impregnated with resin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;30;Following written instructions from the designers workers create highly contoured skin panels by setting individual plies on bond mold tools and sandwiching cores between additional plies as directed,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;31;Completed layups as the layers of prepreg affixed to the mold are called are then transported to an autoclave for curing,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;32;An autoclave is a machine that laminates plastics by exposing them to pressurized steam and curing is the hardening that occurs as the resin layers cook in the autoclave,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;33;Visible trim lines are molded into the panels by scribe lines present in the bond mold tools,Relevant

MadeHow;Helicopter;39;Front panels subject to bird strike or other impact may be laminated of two sheets for greater thickness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;40;All such parts are made by placing an oversized blank on a fixture heating it and then forming it to the required curvature by use of air pressure in a freeblowing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;41;In this method no tool surface touches the optical surfaces to cause defects,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;42;Modern helicopter engines are turbine rather than piston type and are purchased from an engine supplier,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;43;The helicopter manufacturer may purchase or produce the transmission assembly which transfers power to the rotor assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;44;Transmission cases are made of aluminum or magnesium alloy,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Helicopter;53;Finished and inspected detail airframe parts including sheet metal tubular and machined and welded items are delivered to subassembly jigs (fixtures that clamp parts being assembled),Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;54;Central parts are located in each jig and associated details are either bolted in place or where rivets are to be used matchdrilled using pneumatically powered drills to drill and ream each rivet hole,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;55;For aerodynamic smoothness on sheet metal or composite skin panels holes are countersunk so that the heads of flatheaded screws wont protrude,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;56;All holes are deburred and rivets applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;57;A sealant is often applied in each rivet hole as the rivet is inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;58;For some situations semiautomated machines may be used for moving from one hole location to the next drilling reaming sealing and installing the rivets under operator control,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Helicopter;59;After each subassembly is accepted by an inspector it typically moves to another jig to be further combined with other small subassemblies and details such as brackets,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Jet Engine;1;Building and assembling the components of a jet engine takes about two years after a design and testing period that can take up to five years for each model,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;2;The research and development phase is so protracted because the engines are so complex a standard Boeing 747 engine for example contains almost 25000 parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;3;In jet engine manufacture the various parts are made individually as part of subassemblies the subassemblies then come together to form the whole engine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;4;One such part is the fan blade situated at the front of the engine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;5;Each fan blade consists of two blade skins produced by shaping molten titanium in a hot press,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Jet Engine;7;To increase the strength of the final product this cavity is filled with a titanium honeycomb,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;8;The disc the solid core to which the blades of the compressor are attached resembles a big notched wheel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;9;It must be extremely strong and free of even minute imperfections as these could easily develop into fractures under the tremendous stress of engine operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;10;For a long time the most popular way to manufacture the disc entailed machinecutting a metal blank into a rough approximation of the desired shape then heating and stamping it to precise specifications (in addition to rendering the metal malleable heat also helps to fuse hairline cracks),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;11;Today however a more sophisticated method of producing discs is being used by more and more manufacturers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;12;Called powder metallurgy it consists of pouring molten metal onto a rapidly rotating turntable that breaks the metal into millions of microscopic droplets that are flung back up almost immediately  due to the tables spinning,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;13;As they leave the table the droplets temperature suddenly plummets (by roughly 2120 degrees Fahrenheit—1000 degrees Celsius—in half a second) causing them to solidify and form a finegrained metal powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;14;The resulting powder is very pure because it solidifies too quickly to pick up contaminants,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;15;In the next step the powder is packed into a forming case and put into a vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;16;Vibrated the powder sifts down until it is tightly packed at the bottom of the case the vacuum guarantees that no air pockets develop,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;17;The case is then sealed and heated under high pressure (about 25000 pounds per square inch),Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;18;This combination of heat and pressure fuses the metal particles into a disc,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;19;The disc is then shaped on a large cutting machine and bolted to the fan blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;20;Casting an extremely old method is still used to form the compressor blades,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;21;In this process the alloy from which the blades will be formed is poured into a ceramic mold heated in a furnace and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;22;When the mold is broken off the blades are machined to their final shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;23;Combustion chambers must blend air and fuel in a small space and work for prolonged periods in extreme heat,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;24;To accomplish this titanium is alloyed to increase its ductility—its ability to formed into shapes,Relevant

MadeHow;Jet Engine;27;The turbine disc is formed by the same powder metallurgy process used to create the compressor disc,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;28;Turbine blades however are made by a somewhat different method than that used to form compressor blades because they are subjected to even greater stress due to the intense heat of the combustor that lies just in front of them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;29;First copies of the blades are formed by pouring wax into metal molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;30;Once each wax shape has set it is removed from the mold and immersed in a ceramic slurry bath forming a ceramic coating about 25inch (63centimeter) thick,Relevant

MadeHow;Jet Engine;33;The internal air cooling passages within each blade are also formed during this stage of production,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;34;The metal grains in the blade are now aligned parallel to the blade by a process called directional solidifying,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;35; The grain direction is important because the turbine blades are subjected to so much stress if the grains are aligned correctly the blade is much less likely to fracture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;36;The solidifying process takes place in computercontrolled ovens in which the blades are carefully heated according to precise specifications,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;37;The metal grains assume the correct configuration as they cool following their removal from the ovens,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Jet Engine;46;Assembly begins with bolting the high pressure turbine (that closest to the combustor) to the lowpressure turbine (that furthest from the cumbustor),Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;47;Next the combustion chamber is fastened to the turbines,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;48;One process that is used to build a balanced turbine assembly utilizes a CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) robot capable of selecting analyzing and joining a turbine blade to its hub,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;49;This robot can determine the weight of a blade and place it appropriately for a balanced assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;50;Once the turbines and combustion chamber have been assembled the high and low pressure compressors are attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;51;The fan and its frame comprise the forward most subassembly and they are connected next,Relevant
MadeHow;Jet Engine;52;The main drive shaft connecting the low pressure turbine to the low pressure compressor and fan is then installed thus completing the engine core,Relevant

MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;6;Machines of this design can house upwards of 60 different punch geometries and move and strike the sheet metal at high speeds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;7;Most sheet metal cabinetry manufacturers use this technology extensively,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;8;Neither computer programmed nor automated conventional punch presses perform hard tooling in other words they punch only a particular shape and size hole,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;9;Sheet metal is placed into a die by an operator,Relevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;10;As the press moves downward the sheet metal is punched,Relevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;11;These machines cost less than CNC Presses but the sheet metal must be placed in numerous presses to obtain the desired configuration of punches,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Laboratory Incubator;12;After the sheet metal has been sheared and perforated some pieces need to be bent in machines known as power press brakes or brakes for short,Relevant

MadeHow;Lipstick;14;If the lipstick mass is stored before it is used it must be reheated checked for color consistency and adjusted to specifications then maintained at the melt temperature (with agitation) until it can be poured,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;15;As expected lipsticks are always prepared in batches because of the different color pigments that can be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;16;The size of the batch and the number of tubes of lipstick produced at one time will depend on the popularity of the particular shade being produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;17;This will determine the manufacturing technique (automated or manual) that is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;18;Lipstick may be produced in highly automated processes at rates of up to 2400 tubes an hour or in essentially manual operations at rates around 150 tubes per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;19;The steps in the process basically differ only in the volume produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;20;Once the lipstick mass is mixed and free of air it is ready to be poured into the tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;21;A variety of machine setups are used depending on the equipment that the manufacturer has but high volume batches are generally run through a melter that agitates the lipstick mass and maintains it as a liquid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;22;For smaller manually run batches the mass is maintained at the desired mix temperature with agitation in a melter controlled by an operator,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;23;The melted mass is dispensed into a mold which consists of the bottom portion of the metal or plastic tube and a shaping portion that fits snugly with the tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;24;Lipstick is poured upside down so that the bottom of the tube is at the top of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;25;Any excess is scraped from the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;26;The lipstick is cooled (automated molds are kept cold manually produced molds are transferred to a refrigeration unit) and separated from the mold and the bottom of the tube is sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;27;The lipstick then passes through a flaming cabinet (or is flamed by hand) to seal pinholes and improve the finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;28;The lipstick is visually inspected for air holes mold separation lines or blemishes and is reworked if necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;29;For obvious reasons rework of the lipstick must be limited demonstrating the importance of the early steps in removing air from the lipstick mass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;30;Lipstick is reworked by hand with a spatula,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;31;This can be done inline or the tube can be removed from the manufacturing process and reworked,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;32;After the lipstick is retracted and the tube is capped the lipstick is ready for labeling and packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;33;Labels identify the batch and are applied as part of the automated operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;34;While there is a great deal of emphasis on quality and appearance of the finished lipstick product less emphasis is placed on the appearance of lip balms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;35;Lip balms are always produced in an automated process (except for experimental or test batches),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;36;The heated liquid is poured into the tube in the retracted position the tube is then capped by machine—a far less laborious process,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;37;The final step in the manufacturing process is the packaging of the lipstick tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;38;There are a variety of packaging options available ranging from bulk packs to individual packs and including packaging as a component in a makeup kit or special promotional offering,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;39;Lip balms are packaged in bulk generally with minimum protection to prevent shipping damage,Relevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;40;Packaging for lipsticks varies depending on what will happen at the point of sale in the retail outlet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lipstick;41;Packaging may or may not be highly automated and the package used depends on the end use of the product rather than on the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);1;Making passive matrix LCDs is a multistep process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);2;The surface and rear glass of the display is first polished washed and coated with silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ),Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);3;Next a layer of indium tin oxide is evaporated onto the glass and etched into the desired pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);4;A layer of long chain polymer is then applied to allow the liquid crystals to align properly followed by a sealing resin,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);5;The spacers next are put into place and the glass sandwich is filled with the liquid crystal material,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);6;First the two glass substrates must be cut to the proper size polished and washed,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);7;Cutting can be done with a diamond saw or scribe while polishing involves a process called lapping in which the glass is held against a rotating wheel that has abrasive particles embedded in it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);8;After being washed and dried the substrates are coated with a layer of silicon dioxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);9;Next the transparent electrode pattern must be made on the substrates,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);10;This is done by completely coating both front and rear glass surfaces with a very thin layer of indium tin oxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);11;Manufacturers then make a mask of the desired pattern using either a silkscreening or photolithography process,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);12;They apply the finished mask to the fully coated glass and areas of indium tin oxide that are not needed are etched away chemically,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);13;Alternatively finer definition can be achieved by using glass that has a layer of etchingresistant lightsensitive material (called photoresist) above the indium tin oxide film,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);14;A mask with the desired pattern is placed over the glass and the glass is bombarded with ultraviolet light,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);15;This light causes the resistive layer it shines on to lose its resistance to etching allowing the chemicals to eat away both the exposed photoresist and the indium tin oxide below it thus forming the pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);16;The unnecessary photoresist that remains can then be removed with other chemicals,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);17;A second variety of resistive film resists etching only after it is exposed to ultraviolet light in this case a negative mask of the pattern must be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);18;Regardless of which method is used the patterns on the two substrates are designed to overlap only in specific places a design that ensures that the thin strips of indium tin oxide conveying voltage to each element have no electrode positioned directly opposite that might show up while the cell is working,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);19;After the electrode pattern is in place the substrates must be coated with a polymer,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);20;The polymer allows the liquid crystals to align properly with the glass surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);21;Polyvinyl alcohol polyamides and some silanes can be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);22;Polyamides are the most popular agents because polyvinyl alcohol is subject to moisture problems and silanes produce a thin unreliable coating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);23;After coating the glass manufacturers then stroke the polymer coat in a single direction with soft material,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);24;This can result in small parallel grooves being etched into the polymer or it may simply stretch the polymer coat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);25;In any case this process forces the liquid crystals to lie parallel to the direction of the stroke,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);26;The crystals may be aligned another way by evaporating silicon oxide onto the glass surface at an oblique angle,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);27;This procedure is used to make most digital watch displays but is not convenient for making largescale displays,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);28;It also does not yield the lowtilt angle possible with the previous method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);29;If LCD makers want to align liquid crystals perpendicular to the glass surface another technique is used coating the glass with an amphophilic material,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);30;This is material whose molecules display affinity for water at one end of the molecule and repulsion from water at the other end,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);31;One end—the affinity end—adheres to the glass surface while the other end—the repulsing end—points into the liquid crystal area repelling the liquid crystals and forming them into an alignment that is perpendicular to the glass surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);32;A sealing resin is next applied to the substrates followed by plastic spacers that will give the liquid crystal cell the proper thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);33;Next the liquid crystal material is injected into the appropriate area between the two glass substrates,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);34;The thickness of the LCD cell is usually restricted to 525 micrometers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);35;Because proper thickness is crucial for cell operation and because spacers dont always achieve uniform thickness LCD makers sometimes put appropriately sized glass fibers or beads in the liquid crystal material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);36;The beads or fibers cannot be seen by the naked eye,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);37;They help hold the cell at the proper thickness while the sealant material is setting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);38;To make LCDs more visible polarizers are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);39;These are usually made from stretched polyvinyl alcohol films that have iodine in them and that are sandwiched between cellulose acetate layers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);40;Colored polarizers made using dye instead of iodine are also available,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);41;Manufacturers glue the polarizer to the glass using an acrylic adhesive and cover it with a plastic protective film,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);42;They can make reflective polarizers which also are used in LCDs by incorporating a simple metal foil reflector,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);43;After the polarizer film is attached the unit is allowed to age,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);44;Finally the finished glass display assembly is mounted to the circuit boards containing the control and drive electronics,Relevant
MadeHow;Liquid Crystal Display (LCD);45;Then the entire package is ready to be mounted to the device using the LCD—laptop computer fax machine clock etc,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;1;Lube oil is extracted from crude oil which undergoes a preliminary purification process (sedimentation) before it is pumped into fractionating towers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;2;A typical highefficiency fractionating tower 25 to 35 feet (76 to 106 meters) in diameter and up to 400 feet (122 meters) tall is constructed of high grade steels to resist the corrosive compounds present in crude oils inside it is fitted with an ascending series of condensate collecting trays,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;3;Within a tower the thousands of hydrocarbons in crude oil are separated from each other by a process called fractional distillation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;4; As the vapors rise up through the tower the various fractions cool condense and return to liquid form at different rates determined by their respective boiling points (the lower the boiling point of the fraction the higher it rises before condensing),Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;5;Natural gas reaches its boiling point first followed by gasoline kerosene fuel oil lubricants and tars,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;6;The crude oil is transported from the oil well to the refinery by pipeline or tanker ship,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;7;At the refinery the oil undergoes sedimentation to remove any water and solid contaminants such as sand and rock that maybe suspended in it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;8;During this process the crude is pumped into large holding tanks where the water and oil are allowed to separate and the contaminants settle out of the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;9;Next the crude oil is heated to about 700 degrees Fahrenheit (371 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;10;At this temperature it breaks down into a mixture of hot vapor and liquid that is then pumped into the bottom of the first of two fractionating towers,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;11;Here the hot hydrocarbon vapors float upward,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;12;As they cool they condense and are collected in different trays installed at different levels in the tower,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;13;In this tower normal atmospheric pressure is maintained continuously and about 80 percent of the crude oil vaporizes,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;14;The remaining 20 percent of the oil is then reheated and pumped into a second tower wherein vacuum pressure lowers the residual oils boiling point so that it can be made to vaporize at a lower temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;15;The heavier compounds with higher boiling points such as tar and the inorganic compounds remain behind for further processing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;16;After further processing to remove unwanted compounds the lube oil that has been collected in the two fractionating towers is passed through several ultrafine filters which remove remaining impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;17;Aromatics one such contaminant contain sixcarbon rings that would affect the lube oils viscosity if they werent removed in a process called solvent extraction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;18; Solvent extraction is possible because aromatics are more soluble in the solvent than the lube oil fraction is,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;19;When the lube oil is treated with the solvent the aromatics dissolve later after the solvent has been removed the aromatics can be recovered from it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;20;Finally the oil is mixed with additives to give it the desired physical properties (such as the ability to withstand low temperatures),Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;21;At this point the lube oil is subjected to a variety of quality control tests that assess its viscosity specific gravity color flash and fire points,Relevant
MadeHow;Lubricating Oil;22;Oil that meets quality standards is then packaged for sale and distribution,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;1;Most mattress manufacturers subcontract the production of the innerspring unit to an outside firm that specializes in making springs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;2;Once the completed spring unit is received and inspected the workers manually apply the insulator,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;3;Next they apply the cushioning layers that will determine the feel and comfort of the final product,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;4;While the mattress is being built up in one part of the plant the decorative cover that will serve as the exterior for the top bottom and sides is being made in another part,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;5;Usually this cover is made on a giant quilting machine which controls a multitude of needles that stitch the cover to a layer of backing material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;6;The stitching chosen serves both useful and ornamental purposes as it must prevent the mattress cover from slipping or creeping over the layers of cushioning in addition to creating a visually pleasing exterior,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;7;Once the fabric is quilted it is cut into panels that will fit the top and bottom of the mattress,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;8;The side panels are often cut from this same composite or made separately on a border machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;9;If side handles or vents are to be added they are attached to the side panels before these are applied to the mattress,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;10;Specially modified sewing machines are used to attach the flanges to the top and bottom panels and the hogs rings are stapled to the flanges,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;11;Everything is now ready for the closing operation during which the hogs rings will be secured to the innerspring unit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;12;The closing operation is of one of the most highly skilled and critical procedures in the entire process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;13;It is done with a movable sewing head that is mounted on a track,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;14;Tape edge operators manually feed the top bottom and side panels and a heavy duty binding tape into the sewing machine as it moves around the mattress,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;15;As this combination of materials is fed into the machine the operators uses their skill to feed the proper amount of each material into the machine to produce a professionally tailored product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;16;Some of the highest quality mattresses may also feature a pillowtop a panel filled with soft upholstery and attached to the top and bottom panels of the mattress for a more luxurious feel and appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;17;Prequilted the pillowtop is then taped to the mattress,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;18;If the desired boxspring has a spiked coil design it is made by stapling the bottom of each coil to a flat wooden frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;19;A wire grid is then placed on top of the springs and once aligned manually locked to them,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;20;A thin layer of upholstery is applied to the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;21;If the desired boxspring contains no springs it consists of a wooden frame that may or may not have a layer of upholstery attached to its top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;22;Regardless of the internal composition the frame is usually inserted into a presewn cover that encases the top and sides of the unit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;23;A border fabric that matches the mattress exterior is applied to the sides and a dust cover is added to the face,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;24;Once the units are complete they are inspected for quality,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;25;If every thing is in order they are labeled with the content and the contingent do not remove tag required by law to ensure the consumer that the contents are properly represented in the labeling,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;26;The finished product is then transported to the packing area,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;27;Here it is inserted by hand or by automated machinery into protective plastic or paper covers,Relevant
MadeHow;Mattress ;28;Additional information about the warranty safety and care of the product is also included in the packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;1;The process of manufacturing a microwave oven starts with the cavity and the door,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;2;First the frame is formed using automatic metalforming presses that make about 12 to 15 parts per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;3;The frame is then rinsed in alkaline cleaner to get rid of any dirt or oil and further rinsed with water to get rid of the alkaline solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;4;Next each part is treated with zinc phosphate which prepares it for electrodeposition,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;5;Electrodeposition consists of immersing the parts in a paint tank at 200 volts for 25 minutes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;6;The resulting coating is about 15 mils thick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;7;The parts are then moved through a paint bake operation where the paint is cured at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;8;After the door has been painted a perforated metal plate is attached to its window aperture,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;9;The plate reflects microwaves but allows light to enter the cavity (the door will not be attached to the cavity until later when the chassis is assembled),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;10;The magnetron tube assembly consists of a cathode cylinder a filament heater a metal anode and an antenna,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;11;The filament is attached to the cathode and the cathode is enclosed in the anode cylinder this cell will provide the electricity that will help to generate the microwaves,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;12;Metal cooling fins are welded to the anode cylinder and a powerful magnet is placed around the anode to provide the magnetic field in which the microwaves will be generated,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;13;A metal strap holds the complete assembly together,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;14;A thermal protector is mounted directly on the magnetron to prevent damage to the tube from overheating,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;15;An antenna enclosed in a glass tube is mounted on top of the anode and the air within the tube is pumped out to create a vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;16;The waveguide is connected to the magnetron on top of the protruding antenna while a blower motor used to cool the metal fins of the magnetron is attached directly to the tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;17;Finally a plastic fan is attached to the motor where it will draw air from outside the oven and direct it towards the vanes,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;18;This completes the magnetron subassembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;19;The chassis assembly work is performed on a pallet—a workholding device used in conjunction with other tools—located at the station,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;20;First the main chassis is placed on the pallet and the cavity is screwed on to the chassis,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;21;Next the door is attached to the cavity and chassis by means of hinges,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;22;The magnetron tube is then bolted to the side of the cavity and the main chassis,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;23;The circuit that produces the voltage required to operate the magnetron tube consists of a large transformer an oilbased capacitor and a high voltage rectifier,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;24;All of these components are mounted directly on the chassis close to the magnetron tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;25;The stirrer fan used to circulate the microwaves is mounted on top of the cavity,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;26;Some manufacturers use a pulley to drive the fan from the magnetron blower motor others use a separate stirrer motor attached directly to the fan,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;27;Once the stirrer fan is attached a stirrer shield is screwed on top of the fan assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;28;The shield prevents dirt and grease from entering the waveguide where they could produce arcing and damage the magnetron,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;29;The cook switch provides power to the transformer by energizing a relay and a timer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;30;The relay is mounted close to the power transformer while the timer is mounted on the control board,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;31;The defrost switch works like the cook switch activating a motor and timer to operate the defrost cycle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;32;Also mounted on the control board are a timer bell that rings when the cooking cycle is complete and a light switch that allows viewing of the cavity,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;33;A number of interlocking switches are mounted near the top and bottom of the door area,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;34;The interlocking switches are sometimes grouped together with a safety switch that monitors the other switches and provides protection if the door accidently opens during oven operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;35;A front panel that allows the operator to select the various settings and features available for cooking is attached to the chassis,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;36;Behind the front panel the control circuit board is attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;37;The board which controls the various programmed operations in their proper sequence when the switches are pushed on the front panel is connected to the various components and the front panel by means of plugin sockets and cables,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;38;The outer case of the microwave is made of metal and is assembled on a roll former,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;39;The case is slipped onto the preassembled microwave oven and bolted to the main chassis,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;40;The power cords and dial knobs are now attached to the oven and it is sent for automatic testing,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;41;Most manufacturers run the oven from 50100 hours continuously as part of the testing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;42;After testing is complete a palletizer robot records the model and serial data of the oven for inventory purposes and the oven is sent for packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Microwave Oven;43;This completes the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;1;The first step in manufacturing any mirror is cutting the outline of the glass blank to suit the application,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;2;If the mirror is for an automobile for example the glass will be cut out to fit in the mirror mount on the car,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;3;Although some mirror manufacturers cut their own glass others receive glass that has already been cut into blanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;4;Regardless of who cuts the glass very hard finely pointed blades are used to do the cutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;5;Diamond scribes or saws—sharp metal points or saws with diamond dust embedded in them—are often used because the diamond will wear down the glass before the glass wears down the diamond,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;6;The cutting method used depends entirely on the final shape the mirror will take,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;7;In one method the blades or scribes may be used to cut partway through the glass pressure can then be used to break the glass along the score line,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;8;In another method a machine uses a diamond saw to cut all the way through the glass by drawing the blade back and forth or up and down multiple times like an automated bandsaw,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;9;Cutting is usually done before the metal coating is applied because the coating may flake off the glass as a result of the cut,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;10;An alternative to cutting the glass to form blanks is to mold the glass in its molten state,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;11;Blanks are then placed in optical grinding machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;12;These machines consist of large base plates full of depressions that hold the blanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;13;The blankfilled base is placed against another metal plate with the desired surface shape flat convex or concave,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;14;A grinding compound—a gritty liquid—is spread over the glass blanks as they are rubbed or rolled against the curved surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;15;The action is similar to grinding spices with a mortar and pestle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;16;The grit in the compound gradually wears away the glass surface until it assumes the same shape as the grinding plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;17;Finer and finer grits are used until the surface is very smooth and even,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;18;Hand grinding techniques exist as well but they are extremely timeconsuming and difficult to control,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;19;They are only used in cases where mechanical grinding would be impossible as is the case with very large or unusually shaped surfaces,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;20;A commercial optical grinder can accommodate 50 to 200 blanks which are all polished simultaneously,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;21;This is much more efficient than hand grinding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;22;Even specialty optics can be made mechanically in adjustable equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;23;When the glass surfaces are shaped appropriately and polished to a smooth finish they are coated with whatever reflective material the designer has chosen,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;24;Regardless of the coating material it is applied in an apparatus called an evaporator,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;25;The evaporator is a large vacuum chamber with an upper plate for supporting the blank mirrors and a lower crucible for melting the coating metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;26;It is so called because metal is heated in the crucible to the point that it evaporates into the vacuum depositing a coating on the surface of the glass much like hot breath will steam a cold window,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;27;Blanks are centered over holes in the upper plate that allow the metal vapor to reach the surface of the glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;28;Metals can be heated to several hundreds or thousands of degrees (depending on the boiling point of the metal) before they vaporize,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;29;The temperature and timing for this procedure are controlled very precisely to achieve exactly the right thickness of metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;30;This method of coating creates very uniform and highly reflective surfaces,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;31;The shape of the holes in the upper plate will be transferred to the glass in metal like paint through a stencil,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;32;This effect is often used to intentionally pattern the mirror,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;33;Metal stencils or masks can be applied to the surface of the glass to create one or more patterns,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;34;Dielectric coatings—either as reflective layers or as protective layers over metal ones—are applied in much the same way except that gases are used instead of metal chunks,Relevant
MadeHow;Mirror;35;Silicon oxides and silicon nitrides are typically used as dielectric coatings,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;36;When these gases combine in extreme heat they react to form a solid substance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;37;This reaction product forms a coating just like metal does,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;38;Several evaporation steps may be combined to make a multiplelayer coating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;39;Clear dielectric materials may be evaporated on top of metal or other dielectrics to change the reflective or mechanical properties of a surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;40;Mirrors with silvering on the back of the glass for instance often have an opaque dielectric layer applied to improve the reflectivity and keep the metal from scratching,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;41;Oneway mirrors are the exception to this procedure in which case great care must be taken not to damage the thin metal coating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mirror;42;Finally when the proper coatings have been applied the finished mirror is mounted in a base or packed carefully in a shock resistant package for shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;1;Early methods of making nail polish used a variety of methods that today look charmingly amateurish,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;2;One common technique was to mix cleaned scraps of movie film and other cellulose with alcohol and castor oil and leave the mixture to soak overnight in a covered container,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;3;The mixture was then strained colored and perfumed,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;4;Though recognizable as nail polish the product was far from what we have available today,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;5;The modern manufacturing process is a very sophisticated operation utilizing highly skilled workers advanced machinery and even robotics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;6;Todays consumers expect a nail polish to apply smoothly evenly and easily to set relatively quickly and to be resistant to chipping and peeling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;7;In addition the polish should be dermatologically innocuous,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;8;The pigments are mixed with nitrocellulose and plasticizer using a tworoll differential speed mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;9;This mill grinds the pigment between a pair of rollers that are able to work with increasing speed as the pigment is ground down,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;10;The goal is to produce fine dispersion of the color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;11;A variation of this mill is the Banbury Mixer (used also in the production of rubber for rubber bands),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;12;When properly and fully milled the mixture is removed from the mill in sheet form and then broken up into small chips for mixing with the solvent,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;13;The mixing is performed in stainless steel kettles that can hold anywhere from 5 to 2000 gallons,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;14;Stainless steel must be used because the nitrocellulose is extremely reactive in the presence of iron,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;15;The kettles are jacketed so that the mixture can be cooled by circulating cold water or another liquid around the outside of the kettle,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;16;The temperature of the kettle and the rate of cooling are controlled by both computers and technicians,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;17;This step is performed in a special room or area designed to control the hazards of fire and explosion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;18;Most modern factories perform this step in an area with walls that will close in if an alarm sounds and in the event of explosion with ceilings that will safely blow off without endangering the rest of the structure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;19;Materials are mixed in computerized closed kettles,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;20;At the end of the process the mix is cooled slightly before the addition of such other materials as perfumes and moisturizers,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;21;The mixture is then pumped into smaller 55 gallon drums and then trucked to a production line,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail Polish;22;The finished nail polish is pumped into explosion proof pumps and then into smaller bottles suitable for the retail market,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;1;In the workroom an operator first spreads the 40yard bolts of cloth on a long cutting table,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;2;Cutting the outer fabric is done by a skilled hand to maximize the yield or the number of ties cut from the piece of goods,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;3;If the fabric has a random design the operator stacks between 24 and 72 plies of fabric pieces in preparation for cutting the fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;4;If pattern of the fabric (or of the goods) consists of panels such as stripes with a medallion at the bottom these panels are then stacked according to the pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;5;Using the chain stitch of a sewing machine sewing operators join the ties three sections on the bias in the neckband area,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;6;The operator now adds the facing or tipping (an extra piece of silk nylon rayon or polyester) to the back of the ties ends,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;7;Facing gives a crisp luxurious hand to the shell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;8;Two types of facing are currently utilized,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;9;Threequarter facing extends six to eight inches upward from the point of the tie while full facing extends even higher ending just under the knot,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;10;A quarter to a half of an inch of the shell of the fabric is now turned under to form a point,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;11;The point is then machinehemmed by the sewing operator,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;12;Quality silk ties are pocket or piecepressed,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;13;This means that the joint at the neck (the piecing) is pressed flat so the wearer will not be inconvenienced by any bulkiness,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;14;The interlining is slipstitched to the outer shell with resilient nylon thread which runs through the middle of the tie,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;15;Most ties are slipstitched with a Liba machine a semiautomated machine that closely duplicates the look and resiliency of hand stitching,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;16;Hand stitching is often used in the manufacture of highquality neckties because it offers maximum resiliency and draping qualities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;17;The technique is characterized by the irregularly spaced stitches on the reverse of the tie when the seam is spread slightly apart by the dangling loose thread with a tiny knot at the end of the reverse of the front apron and by the ease with which the tie can slide up and down this thread,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;18;Using a turning machine or a manual turner (with a rod about 9 12 inches long) an operator turns the tie rightside out by pulling one end of the tie through the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;19;While not yet pressed the tie is almost complete,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;20;On silk ties only the lining is then tucked by hand into the bottom corner of the long end of the tie,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;21;If necessary the operator handtrims the lining to fit the point of the long end,Relevant
MadeHow;Necktie;22;(In all other ties the lining does not reach all the way to the bottom corner),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Necktie;23;A final piece to be sewn on is the loop which serves both as a holder for the thin end of the tie when its being worn and as the manufacturers label,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;1;Both the core and the cladding of an optical fiber are made of highly purified silica glass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;2;An optical fiber is manufactured from silicon dioxide by either of two methods,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;3;The first the crucible method in which powdered silica is melted produces fatter multimode fibers suitable for shortdistance transmission of many light wave signals,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;4;The second the vapor deposition process creates a solid cylinder of core and cladding material that is then heated and drawn into a thinner singlemode fiber for longdistance communication,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;5;There are three types of vapor deposition techniques Outer Vapor Phase Deposition Vapor Phase Axial Deposition and Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition (MCVD),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;6;This section will focus on the MCVD process the most common manufacturing technique now in use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;7;MCVD yields a lowloss fiber wellsuited for longdistance cables,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;8;First a cylindrical preform is made by depositing layers of specially formulated silicon dioxide on the inside surface of a hollow substrate rod,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;9;The layers are deposited by applying a gaseous stream of pure oxygen to the substrate rod,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;10;Various chemical vapors such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl 4 ) germanium tetrachloride (GeCl 4 ) and phosphorous oxychloride (POC1 3 ) are added to the stream of oxygen,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;11;As the oxygen contacts the hot surface of the rod—a flame underneath the rod keeps the walls of the rod very hot—silicon dioxide of high purity is formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;12;The result is a glassy soot several layers thick deposited inside the rod,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;13;This soot will become the core,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;14;The properties of these layers of soot can be altered depending on the types of chemical vapors used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;15;After the soot is built up to the desired thickness the substrate rod is moved through other heating steps to drive out any  moisture and bubbles trapped in the soot layers,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;16;During heating the substrate rod and internal soot layers solidify to form the boule or preform of highly pure silicon dioxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;17;A preform usually measures 10 to 25 millimeters (39 to 98 inch) in diameter and 600 to 1000 millimeters (236 to 3937 inches) in length,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;18;The solid preform is then automatically transferred to a vertical fiber drawing system,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;19;The machines that make up a typical vertical drawing system can be two stories high and are able to produce continuous fibers up to 300 kilometers (186 miles) long,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;20;This system consists of a furnace to melt the end of the preform sensors to monitor the diameter of the fiber being pulled from the preform and coating devices to apply protective layers over the outer cladding,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;21;The preform first passes through a furnace where it is heated to about 3600 degrees Fahrenheit (about 2000 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;22;Next a drop of molten glass called a gob forms at the end of the preform much like a droplet of water that collects at the bottom of a leaky faucet,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;23;The gob then falls away and the single optical fiber inside is drawn out of the preform,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;24;As the optical fiber is pulled from the preform the material in the original substrate rod forms the cladding and the silicon dioxide deposited as soot forms the core of the optical fiber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;25;As the fiber is drawn out measuring devices monitor its diameter and its concentricity while another device applies a protective coating,Relevant
MadeHow;Optical Fiber;26;The fiber then passes through a curing furnace and another measuring device that monitors diameter before being wound on a spool,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;1;Pigment manufacturers send bags of fine grain pigments to paint plants,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;2;There the pigment is premixed with resin (a wetting agent that assists in moistening the pigment) one or more solvents and additives to form a paste,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;3;The paste mixture for most industrial and some consumer paints is now routed into a sand mill a large cylinder that agitates tiny particles of sand or silica to grind the pigment particles making them smaller and dispersing them throughout the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;4;The mixture is then filtered to remove the sand particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;5;Instead of being processed in sand mills up to 90 percent of the waterbased latex paints designed for use by individual homeowners are instead processed in a highspeed dispersion tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;6;There the premixed paste is subjected to highspeed agitation by a circular toothed blade attached to a rotating shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;7;This process blends the pigment into the solvent,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;8;Whether created by a sand mill or a dispersion tank the paste must now be thinned to produce the final product,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;9;Transferred to large kettles it is agitated with the proper amount of solvent for the type of paint desired,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;10;The finished paint product is then pumped into the canning room,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;11;For the standard 8 pint (378 liter) paint can available to consumers empty cans are first rolled horizontally onto labels then set upright so that the paint can be pumped into them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paint;12;A machine places lids onto the filled cans and a second machine presses on the lids to seal them,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;13;From wire that is fed into it from coils a bailometer cuts and shapes the handles before hooking them into holes precut in the cans,Relevant
MadeHow;Paint;14;A certain number of cans (usually four) are then boxed and stacked before being sent to the warehouse,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;1;Nylon yarn is made in a process known as melt spinning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;2; First the chemicals involved—adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine—must be polymerized to form a thick resin that is then cut into chips or pellets,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;3;These pellets are then heated and pressurized in an autoclave into a syrupy solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;4;Next the solution is extruded through a spinneret—a device that looks and works like a shower head with long strings of nylon solution coming out of the holes in the device,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;5;The number of holes depends on the type of yarn desired one hole produces monofilament yarn which is very thin and sheer several holes produce multifilament yarn which is denser and less sheer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;6;As the fibers emerge from the spinneret they are cooled by air and then stretched over rollers to stabilize the molecular chains and strengthen the fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;7;The yarn is then wound on spools,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;8;Yarn is fed into a circular knitting machine which converts it into a series of loops,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;9;Usually computercontrolled the machine contains 300 to 420 needles and rotates at speeds up to 1200 RPM it takes about 90 seconds to knit a fulllength stocking leg,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;10;Next openings at the toes are seamed together and two stocking legs are seamed together to form pantyhose,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;11;Sometimes they are seamed together with a crotch,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;12;Like the other steps in pantyhose manufacture seaming is almost completely automated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;13;The sewn product then goes to a dye machine where it will be dyed to one of more than 100 different shades,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;14;The dye machine can color about 3500 dozen pairs a day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;15;Once dyed the pantyhose are taken to a compartment dryer which dries them,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;16;This next step boarding is sometimes done before the dyeing process depending on the desired final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;17;Boarding is the process of placing the pantyhose over leg forms where they are steamed and heated to the desired shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;18;With less expensive hosiery this step may be completely bypassed and the pantyhose packaged in their relaxed state,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;19;Throughout the manufacturing process quality checks are performed on the pantyhose,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;20;A statistical method is used for inspection,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;21;Pantyhose that meet the inspection guidelines are packaged in a box or paperboard envelope either manually or automatically,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;22;After they leave the manufacturing plant the pantyhose are stored in warehouses and organized according to size style and color for efficient orderfilling,Relevant
MadeHow;Pantyhose;23;Customer orders are filled by personnel at various picking stations positioned alongside a conveyor belt that carries the filled cases to a staging area for final shipping to retail markets,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;1;Peanuts are planted in April or May depending upon the climate,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;2;The peanut emerges as a plant followed by a yellow flower,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;3;After blooming and then wilting the flower bends over and penetrates the soil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;4;The peanut is formed underground,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;5;Peanuts are harvested beginning in late August but mostly in September and October during clear weather when the soil is dry enough so it will not adhere to the stems and pods,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;6;The peanuts are removed from vines by portable mechanical pickers and transported to a peanut sheller for mechanical drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;7;Peanuts from the pickers are delivered to warehouses for cleaning,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;8;Blowers remove dust sand vines stems leaves and empty shells,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;9;Screens magnets and size graders remove trash metal rocks and clods,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;10;After the cleaning process the peanuts weigh 10 to 20 percent less,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;11;The raw cleaned peanuts are stored unshelled in silos or warehouses,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;12;Shelling consists of removing the shell (or hull) of peanuts with the least damage to the seed or kemels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;13;The moisture of the unshelled peanuts is adjusted to avoid excessive brittleness of the shells and kernels and to reduce the amount of dust in the plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;14;The sizegraded peanuts are passed between a series of rollers adjusted to the variety size and condition of the peanuts where the peanuts are cracked,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;15;The cracked peanuts then repeatedly pass over screens sleeves blowers magnets and destoners where they are shaken gently tumbled and air blown until all the shells and other foreign material (rocks mudballs metal shrivels) are removed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;16;The shelled peanuts are graded for size in a size grader,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;17;The peanuts are lifted and then oriented on the perforations of the size grader,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;18;The larger peanuts (the overs) are sent to one trough while the troughs are guided towards another trough,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;19;The peanuts are then graded for color defects spots and broken skins,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;20;The peanuts are shipped in large bulk containers or sacks to peanut butter manufacturers,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;21;(Inedible peanuts are diverted as oil stock in semibulk form),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;22;To ensure proper size and grading the truckloads transporting peanuts to peanut manufacturers are sampled mechanically,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;23;The sampler testing two truckloads simultaneously can quickly and accurately assess size and grading by examining 10 samples per truckload,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;24;If edible peanuts need to be stored for more than 60 days they are placed in refrigerated storage at 34 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 6 degrees Celsius) where they may be held for as long as 25 months,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;25;Shelled the remaining peanuts weigh 30 to 60 percent less occupy 60 to 70 percent less space and have a shelf life about 60 to 75 percent shorter than unshelled peanuts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;26;The peanut butter manufacturers first dry roast the peanuts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;27; Dry roasting is done by either the batch or continuous method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;28;In the batch method peanuts are roasted in 400pound lots in a revolving oven heated to about 800 degrees Fahrenheit (4266 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;29;The peanuts are heated at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius) and held at this temperature for 40 to 60 minutes to reach the exact degree of doneness,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;30;All the nuts in each batch must be uniformly roasted,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;31;Large manufacturers prefer the continuous method in which peanuts are fed from the hopper roasted cooled ground into peanut butter and stabilized in one operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;32;This method is less laborintensive creates a more uniform roasting and decreases spillage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;33;Still some operators believe that the best commercial peanut butter is obtained by using the batch method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;34;Since peanut butter may call for a blending of peanuts the batch method allows for the different varieties to be roasted separately,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;35;Furthermore since peanuts frequently come in lots of different moisture content which may need special attention during roasting the batch method can also meet these needs readily,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;36;The steps outlined below apply to peanut butter manufacturing that uses the batch method of roasting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;37;A photometer indicates when the cooking is complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;38;At the exact time cooking is completed the roasted peanuts are removed from heat as quickly as possible in order to stop cooking and produce a uniform product,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;39;The hot peanuts then pass from the roaster directly to a perforated metal cylinder (or blowercooler vat) where a large volume of air is pulled through the mass by suction fans,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;40;The peanuts are brought to a temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;41;Once cooled the peanuts pass through a gravity separator that removes foreign materials,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;42;The skins (or seed coats) are now removed with either heat or water,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;43;The heat blanching method has the advantage of removing the hearts of the peanuts which contain a bitter principle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;44;Heat blanching Depending on the variety and degree of doneness desired the peanuts are exposed to a temperature of 280 degrees Fahrenheit (1377 degrees Celsius) for up to 20 minutes to loosen and crack the skins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;45;After cooling the peanuts are passed through the blancher in a continuous stream and subjected to a thorough but gentle rubbing between brushes or ribbed rubber belting,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;46;The skins are rubbed off blown into porous bags and the hearts are separated by screening,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;47;Water blanching A newer process than heat blanching water blanching was introduced in 1949,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;48;While the kernels are not heated to destroy natural antioxidants drying is necessary in this process and the hearts are retained,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;49;The first step is to arrange the kernels in troughs then roll them between sharp stationary blades to slit the skins on opposite sides,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;50;The skins are removed as a spiral conveyor carries the kernels through a oneminute scalding water bath and then under an oscillating canvascovered pad which rubs off their skins,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;51;The blanched kernels are then dried for at least six hours by a current of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (488 degrees Celsius) air,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;52;The blanched nuts are mechanically screened and inspected on a conveyor belt to remove scorched and rotten nuts or other undesirable matter,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;53;Light nuts are removed by blowers discolored nuts by a highspeed electric color sorter and metal parts by magnets,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;54;Most of the devices used for grinding peanuts into butter are built so they can be adjusted over a wide range—permitting the variation in the quantity of peanuts ground per hour the fineness of the product and the amount of oil freed from the peanuts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;55;Most grinding mills also have an automatic feed for peanuts and salt and are easy to clean,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;56;To prevent overheating grinding mills are cooled by a water jacket,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;57;Peanut butter is usually made by two grinding operations,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;58;The first reduces the nuts to a medium grind and the second to a fine smooth texture,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;59;For fine grinding clearance between plates is about 032 inch (08 centimeter),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;60;The second milling uses a very highspeed comminutor that has a combination cuttingshearing and attrition action and operates at 9600 rpm,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;61;This milling produces a very fine particle with a maximum size of less than 001 inch (025 centimeter),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;62;To make chunky peanut butter peanut pieces approximately the size of oneeighth of a kernel are mixed with regular peanut butter or incomplete grinding is used by removing a rib from the grinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;63;At the same time the peanuts are fed into the grinder to be milled about 2 percent salt dextrose and hydrogenated oil stabilizer are fed into the grinder in a continuous horizontal operation with about plus or minus 2 percent accuracy and are thoroughly dispersed,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;64;Peanuts are kept under constant pressure from the start to the finish of the grinding process to assure uniform grinding and to protect the product from air bubbles,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;65;A heavy screw feeds the peanuts into the grinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;66;This screw may also deliver the deaerated peanut butter into containers in a continuous stream under even pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;67;From the grinder the peanut butter goes to a stainless steel hopper which serves as an intermediate mixing and storage point,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;68;The stabilized peanut butter is cooled in this rotating refrigerated cylinder (called a votator) from 170 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (766 to 488 degrees Celsius) or less before it is packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;69;The stabilized peanut butter is automatically packed in jars capped and labeled,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;70;Since proper packaging is the main factor in reducing oxidation (without oxygen no oxidation can occur) manufacturers use vacuum packing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;71;After it is put into final containers the peanut butter is allowed to remain undisturbed until crystallization throughout the mass is completed,Relevant
MadeHow;Peanut Butter;72;Jars are then placed in cartons and placed in product storage until ready to be shipped out to retail or institutional customers,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;1;Now that most commercially used graphite is made in factories rather than mined manufacturers are able to easily control its density,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pencil;2;The graphite is mixed with clay according to the type of pencil being made—the more graphite used the softer the pencil and the darker its line,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;3;For colored pencils pigments are added to the clay and virtually no graphite is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;4;Two methods are used to form the graphite into its finished state,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pencil;5;The first is an extrusion method in which the graphite and wax mixture is forced through a mold to create a spaghettilike string which is then cut to precise measurements and dried in ovens,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;6;In the second method the graphite and clay mixture is poured into a machine called a billet press,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;7; A plug is placed over the top of the press and a metal ram ascends from the bottom to squash the mixture into a hard solid cylinder called a billet,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;8;The billet is then removed from the top of the machine and placed into an extrusion press that forces it through a mold slicing off strips the size of the pencil core ,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;9;After being cut to size the cores pass along a conveyor belt and are collected in a trough to await insertion in the pencil wood ,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;10;The cedar usually arrives at the factory already dried stained and waxed to prevent warping ,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;11;Logs are then sawed into narrow strips called slats these are about 725 inches (184 centimeters) long 25 inch (635 centimeter) thick and 275 inches (698 centimeters) wide,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;12;The slats are placed into a feeder and dropped onebyone onto a conveyor belt which moves them along at a constant rate,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;13;The slats are then planed to give them a flat surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;14;Next they pass under a cutter head that makes parallel semicircular grooves—one half as deep as the graphite is thick—along the length of one side of each slat,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;15;Continuing along the conveyor belt half of the slats are coated with a layer of glue and the cut graphite is laid in the grooves of these slats,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;16;The slats without glue—and without graphite in the grooves—are placed on another belt that carries them to a machine that picks them up and turns them over so they are laying on the belt with the grooves facing down,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;17;The two conveyor belts then meet and each unglued slat is placed over a slat with glue and graphite forming a sandwich,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;18;After the sandwiches have been removed from the conveyor belt they are placed into a metal clamp and squeezed by a hydraulic press and left clamped together until the glue is dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;19;When the pencils are dried the ends are trimmed to remove excess glue,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;20;The next step is shaping when the sandwiches actually become pencils,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;21;The sandwiches are placed on a conveyor belt and moved through two sets of cutters one above and one below the belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;22;The cutters above the sandwiches cut around the top half while the lower set cuts around the bottom half and separates the finished pencils,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;23;The majority of pencils are hexagonal so designed to keep the pencils from rolling off surfaces a single sandwich yields six to nine hexagonal pencils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pencil;24;After the pencils have been cut their surfaces are smoothed by sanders and varnish is applied and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;25;This is done with varnishing machines in which the pencils are immersed in a vat of varnish and then passed through a felt disk which removes the excess varnish,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;26;After drying the pencils are put through the process again and again until the desired color is achieved,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;27;Finally the pencils receive a finishing coat,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;28;The pencils once again are sent on a conveyor belt through shaping machines which remove any excess varnish that has accumulated on the ends of the pencils,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;29;This step also ensures that all of the pencils are the same length,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;30;Erasers are then attached held to the pencil by a round metal case called a ferrule,Relevant
MadeHow;Pencil;31;The ferrule first attaches to the pencil either with glue or with small metal prongs and then the eraser is inserted and the ferrule clamped around it In the final step a heated steel die presses the company logo onto each pencil ,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;1;Manufacturing a pesticide involves at least three separate activities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;2;The active ingredient is first synthesized in a chemical factory then formulated in the same place or sent to a formulator who prepares the liquid or powder form,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;3;The pesticide is then sent to the farmer or other certified applicator who dilutes it before applying it to the fields,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;4;When a new pesticide is first developed it is manufactured on a small scale in a laboratory,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;5;If the substance proves viable production begins in the factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;6;Batch or continuous manufacturing insures a high volume perhaps as much as 500 kilograms per cycle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;7;Synthesizing a pesticide is a complex chemical procedure that requires trained chemists and a large sophisticated laboratory,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;8;The basic procedure entails altering an organic molecule to form a pesticide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;9;This may involve any of a number of specific reagents and catalysts and often must take place in a controlled climate (within a certain temperature range for example),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;10;Once synthesized the active ingredient is packaged and sent to a formulator,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;11;Liquid insecticides can be shipped in tank trucks or 200liter drums,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;12;Transport of the active ingredient follows all regulations for hazardous materials transportation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;13;A formulator accepts the active ingredient measures out the proper amount mixes it with carrier if it is to be a liquid pesticide or with inert powders or dry fertilizers if it is to be a dust pesticide then bottles or packages it,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;14;Liquid pesticides are packaged in 200liter drums if a largescale farmer is the anticipated customer or 20liter jugs for smallscale operations,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;15;Dry formulations can be packaged in 5 to 10 kilogram plastic or plasticlined bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;16;An emulsified formulation is usually concentrated to render transport easier (the active ingredient typically makes up 50 percent of the emulsified concentrate) but granulated and dry pesticides are ready to use,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;17;The pesticide might be stored a short time before it is requested,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;18;When it is ready for transport the estimated necessary amount is sent to the farmer who dilutes the emulsified concentrate to create the amount of pesticide desired,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;19;In most instances the final product consists of only ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;20;5 to 1 percent of the original active ingredient,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;21;The pesticide is now ready to be applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;22;There are several ways to apply a pesticide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;23;The method with which Americans are most familiar is crop dusting though its use is generally limited to large flat areas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;24;A plane loaded with 2000liter (or larger) tanks flies over a field and sprays out the pesticide from booms,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;25;Booms are long horizontal rods from which several sprinklers spray down,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;26;Another method is to attach the tanks and booms to a tractor and spray closer to the ground,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;27;For small farmers the most economical method of spraying is to use one or more workers with handheld sprayers attached to small tanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;28;A hand pump can be carried on the shoulder its tank capacity is only about 3 to 12 liters,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;29;Small tanks with a capacity of around 200 liters are also used,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;30;The pesticides are applied with a hand gun,Relevant
MadeHow;Pesticide ;31;A rough estimate of the amount applied is 150 to 300 liters per hectare,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;1;After the raw materials are selected and the desired amounts weighed they go through a series of preparation steps,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;2;First they are crushed and purified,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;3;Next they are mixed together before being subjected to one of four forming processes—soft plastic forming stiff plastic forming pressing or casting the choice depends upon the type of ware being produced,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;4;After the porcelain has been formed it is subjected to a final purification process bisquefiring before being glazed,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;5;Glaze is a layer of decorative glass applied to and fired onto a ceramic body,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;6;The final manufacturing phase is firing a heating step that takes place in a type of oven called a kiln,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;7;First the raw material particles are reduced to the desired size which involves using a variety of equipment during several crushing and grinding steps,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;8;Primary crushing is done in jaw crushers which use swinging metal jaws,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;9;Secondary crushing reduces particles to 01 inch (25 centimeter) or less in diameter by using mullers (steeltired wheels) or hammer mills rapidly moving steel hammers,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;10;For fine grinding craftspeople use ball mills that consist of large rotating cylinders partially filled with steel or ceramic grinding media of spherical shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;11;The ingredients are passed through a series of screens to remove any under or oversized materials,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;12;Screens usually operated in a sloped position are vibrated mechanically or electromechanically to improve flow,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;13;If the body is to be formed wet the ingredients are then combined with water to produce the desired consistency,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;14;Magnetic filtration is then used to remove iron from the slurries as these watery mixtures of insoluble material are called,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;15;Because iron occurs so pervasively in most clays and will impart an undesirable reddish hue to the body if it oxidizes removing it prior to firing is essential,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;16;If the body is to be formed dry shell mixers ribbon mixers or intensive mixers are typically used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;17;Next the body of the porcelain is formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;18;This can be done using one of four methods depending on the type of ware being produced soft plastic forming where the clay is shaped by manual molding wheel throwing jiggering or ram pressing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;19;In wheel throwing a potter places the desired amount of body on a wheel and shapes it while the wheel turns,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;20;In jiggering the clay is put on a horizontal plaster mold of the desired shape that mold shapes one side of the clay while a heated die is brought down from above to shape the other side,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;21;In ram pressing the clay is put between two plaster molds which shape it while forcing the water out,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;22;The mold is then separated by applying vacuum to the upper half of the mold and pressure to the lower half of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;23;Pressure is then applied to the upper half to free the formed body stiff plastic forming which is used to shape less plastic bodies,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;24;The body is forced through a steel die to produce a column of uniform girth,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;25;This is either cut into the desired length or used as a blank for other forming operations pressing which is used to compact and shape dry bodies in a rigid die or flexible mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;26;There are several types of pressing based on the direction of pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;27;Uniaxial pressing describes the process of applying pressure from only one direction whereas isostatic pressing entails applying pressure equally from all sides slip casting in which a slurry is poured into a porous mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;28;The liquid is filtered out through the mold leaving a layer of solid porcelain body,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;29;Water continues to drain out of the cast layer until the layer becomes rigid and can be removed from the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;30;If the excess fluid is not drained from the mold and the entire material is allowed to solidify the process is known as solid casting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;31;After being formed the porcelain parts are generally bisquefired which entails heating them at a relatively low temperature to vaporize volatile contaminants and minimize shrinkage during firing,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;32;After the raw materials for the glaze have been ground they are mixed with water,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;33;Like the body slurry the glaze slurry is screened and passed through magnetic filters to remove contaminants,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;34;It is then applied to the ware by means of painting pouring dipping or spraying,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;35;Different types of glazes can be produced by varying the proportions of the constituent ingredients such as alumina silica and calcia,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;36;For example increasing the alumina and decreasing the silica produces a matte glaze,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;37;Firing is a further heating step that can be done in one of two types of oven or kiln,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;38;A periodic kiln consists of a single refractorylined sealed chamber with burner ports and flues (or electric heating elements),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;39;It can fire only one batch of ware at a time but it is more flexible since the firing cycle can be adjusted for each product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;40;A tunnel kiln is a refractory chamber several hundred feet or more in length,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;41;It maintains certain temperature zones continuously with the ware being pushed from one zone to another,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;42;Typically the ware will enter a preheating zone and move through a central firing zone before leaving the kiln via a cooling zone,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;43;This type of kiln is usually more economical and energy efficient than a periodic kiln,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;44;During the firing process a variety of reactions take place,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;45;First carbonbased impurities burn out chemical water evolves (at 215 to 395 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 to 200 degrees Celsius) and carbonates and sulfates begin to decompose (at 755 to 1295 degrees Fahrenheit or 400 to 700 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;46;Gases are produced that must escape from the ware,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;47;On further heating some of the minerals break down into other phases and the fluxes present (feldspar and flint) react with the decomposing minerals to form liquid glasses (at 1295 to 2015 degrees Fahrenheit or 700 to 1100 degrees Celsius),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;48;These glass phases are necessary for shrinking and bonding the grains,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;49;After the desired density is achieved (greater than 2195 degrees Fahrenheit or 1200 degrees Celsius) the ware is cooled which causes the liquid glass to solidify thereby forming a strong bond between the remaining crystalline grains,Relevant
MadeHow;Porcelain;50;After cooling the porcelain is complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;1;At the printing plant the process begins with the delivery of paper for stamps with the glue already applied to the back,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;2;Two printing processes are most often used in making stamps the intaglio process (which includes the gravure process) and the offset process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;3;It is not unusual however for a particular stamps specifications to call for the use of both methods,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;4;Intaglio perhaps the oldest means of producing stamps is also the most timeconsuming,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;5;However because this method creates stamps with more distinct images the process has not been pushed aside by newer faster and less expensive methods,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;6;Intaglio involves engraving scratching or etching an image onto a printing plate which in turn transfers that image onto paper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;7;In one wellknown intaglio process called gravure the image is first transferred onto the plate photographically and then etched into the plate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;8;This section however will focus on an engraving process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;9;The engraving method of intaglio begins with the creation of a master die in which the design of the stamp is engraved in reverse,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;10;The design is in the lowered portion of the die—the raised portion of the die will not be reproduced in the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;11;This is an exacting hand process in which the engraver is carefully cutting a mirror image of the original drawing for the stamp,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;12;It might be several weeks before the engraver is satisfied that he or she has created the perfect duplicate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;13;After the die has been completed it is heated to harden the engraved image,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;14;In the next step the hardened intaglio is transferred to a transfer roll which consists of soft steel wrapped around a rodshaped carrier or mandrel and which resembles a shortened rolling pin,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;15;The transfer roll is machinepressed against the master die and rocked back and forth until the master die has created a relief impression on the transfer roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;16;At this point the relief is a positive impression (no longer in reverse),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;17;The process is repeated until the desired number of reliefs has been created on the transfer roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;18;Like the master die the transfer roll is hardened by heating,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;19;It is then pressed against a printing plate leaving another relief again in reverse on the printing plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;20;If there are several reliefs on a transfer roll all can be passed to the printing plate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;21;Several printing plates can be made from the same transfer roll if the decision is made to use more than one machine to produce a particular stamp,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;22;The impression on the plate is in the form of grooves rather than a raised image,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;23;Once the plate is ready for use it is fastened into the printing press and coated with ink,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;24;Inking is done automatically by several processes including spraying ink through small jets or moving an inkcovered roller across a plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;25;The plate is then wiped by a blade called the doctor blade leaving ink only in the grooves,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;26;The plate then presses against the paper leaving a positive impression of the reverse image that was originally copied onto the master die,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;27;If more than one color is involved separate colors are handled by a process known as selective inking,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;28;A particular color of ink is applied by a piece of hard rubber that comes in contact with only the section of the stamp that is to receive that color,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;29;After the ink is applied in one area another piece of rubber with another color for another area is used to ink another portion of the plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;30;The offset method of printing is less expensive than intaglio and can also produce very fine results and it is a common choice for many stamps,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;31;In this method a picture or design is first made photochemically on an aluminum plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;32;Once attached to the printing press the plate is alternately bathed in ink and water the photochemical image gets ink while the nonimage parts are dampened with water which acts as a repellent to the ink and ensures that only the image will be transferred to the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;33;Next the plate presses against a rubber blanket which carries a reverse image of the final picture,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;34;In turn the rubber blanket contacts the paper producing the final positive image,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;35;Perforations can be made either during the printing process by an adjacent machine or less commonly by a separate machine afterwards,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;36;In the first method the sheet of paper is passed through a machine which uses little pins to punch the perforation holes through the paper in a horizontal and vertical grid,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;37;After pushing through the paper the pins meet a matching metal indentation on the other side,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;38;After being perforated the stamps move out of the press,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;39;In the other method of producing perforations called rouletting a wheel similar to a pizza cutter but with pins is rolled across one side of the stamped paper after it has been removed from the printing press laying down a row of holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Postage Stamp;40;Though originally a handoperation this method of perforation is now automated,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;1;The Bourdon tube is the most important part of the instrument,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;2;The tube may be made from solid bar stock by drilling the length to the desired inside diameter and turning the outside diameter on a lathe to achieve the appropriate wall thickness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;3;However most general purpose gauges utilize preformed tubing purchased from a metals supplier,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;4;The gauge builder specifies the desired wall thickness material configuration and diameter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;5;The supplier provides the material in 10 to 12foot (3 to 365meter) lengths ready for production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;6;Most manufacturers have closely guarded proprietary rolling methods for rolling the tubing into the C shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;7;The C shape of the tube is generally formed in an automatic rolling machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;8;This machine contains two precision powered rollers through which the tubing passes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;9;One roller grasps the tubing end and forms the inside radius while the other provides outside pressure to maintain uniform contact with the tubing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;10;Each roller contains a groove that fits around the outside of the tubing these grooves allow the tubing to maintain its circular shape rather than being flattened,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;11;In the rolling process a steel mandrel—a bar that guides the tubing into the rollers and helps it keep its shape—is first inserted though the free end of the tubing and positioned just before the rollers,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;12;This lubricated mandrel is of the desired interior shape of the oval,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;13;The tubing then passes over the mandrel and between the rollers,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;14;One roller contains a clip that grabs the tubing as the roller turns it pulls the tubing and bends it into the C shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;15;The same roller that grabs and bends the tubing also contains a saw blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;16;As the roller continues turning after creating the bend the saw blade on it cuts the tubing to the proper length,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;17;The tubing is then heat treated in ovens,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;18;The socket is basically a block of metal that serves as a connector to the source of the pressure medium a mount for the case dial and movement and as an attachment slot for the Bourdon tube,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;19;One end of the socket is threaded which allows it to be screwed into the pressureproviding apparatus,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;20;The socket may be cast forged extruded or machined from bar stock,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;21;Most sockets are made on automated machining centers that turn drill mill and thread all in one cycle,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;22;General machining practices apply to most socket manufacture,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;23;Movements are geared mechanisms that contain a pinion (a rotating shaft) sector support plates hairspring and spacer columns,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;24;The mechanism converts the somewhat linear displacement of the Bourdon tip into rotary movement as well as providing a means for calibration adjustment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;25;The pointer is fastened to the rotating shaft or pinion and sweeps across the graduated dial indicating the pressure amount,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;26;Most movements are supplied to the gauge builder ready to use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;27;Many types of manufacturing processes are used to produce the movement components and the workmanship of the mechanism closely resembles a clockwork when completed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;28;The case dial and pointer may be sheet metal stampings plastic moldings or castings,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;29;Stampings and moldings require little further processing but castings will require some machining—trimming off excess material for instance—to meet the final requirements,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;30;These components are painted as required and the dials are printed with the appropriate artwork,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;31;Common printing practice utilizing both offset and direct methods is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;32;The lens most commonly is a plastic part made by injection molding whereby the plastic is heated into a molten state and then poured into a mold of the desired shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;33;The attachment feature that secures and seals the lens to the case is designed into the mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;34;Glass lenses are still used but must be retained by a ring of some type,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;35;Glass has fallen out of favor because of the safety problems of breakage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;36;After the Bourdon tube is made its closed end is attached to the socket by soldering brazing or welding,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;37;The free end of the Bourdon tube is precisely located during this assembly operation and then sealed usually by the same means used to join the tube to the socket,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;38;Once the Bourdon tube and socket assembly is secure the tip of the unsupported end of the C is attached to an endpiece,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;39;This endpiece contains a small hole that connects the tip to the geared movement mechanism,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;40;The Bourdon tip doesnt move a great distance within its pressure range typically 125 to 25 inch (31 to 63 centimeter),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;41;Understandably the greater the pressure the farther the tip moves,Relevant
MadeHow;Pressure Gauge;42;The other components—the movement pointer and dial—are then assembled onto the socket as a group,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;1;While there are many variations in the manufacturing process that exploit the versatility of the fiber the following is a description of the procedure that is used in making regular or viscose rayon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;2;Regardless of whether wood pulp or cotton linters are used the basic raw material for making rayon must be processed in order to extract and purify the cellulose,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;3;The resulting sheets of white purified cellulose are then treated to form regenerated cellulose filaments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;4;In turn these filaments are spun into yarns and eventually made into the desired fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;5;Sheets of purified cellulose are steeped in sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) which produces sheets of alkali cellulose,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;6;These sheets are dried shredded into crumbs and then aged in metal containers for 2 to 3 days,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;7;The temperature and humidity in the metal containers are carefully controlled,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;8;After ageing the crumbs are combined and churned with liquid carbon disulfide which turns the mix into orangecolored crumbs known as sodium cellulose xanthate,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;9;The cellulose xanthate is bathed in caustic soda resulting in a viscose solution that looks and feels much like honey,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;10;Any dyes or delusterants in the design are then added,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;11;The syrupy solution is filtered for impurities and stored in vats to age this time between 4 and 5 days,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;12;The viscose solution is next turned into strings of fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;13;This is done by forcing the liquid through a spinneret which works like a showerhead into an acid bath,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;14;If staple fiber is to be produced a large spinneret with large holes is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;15;If filament fiber is being produced then a spinneret with smaller holes is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;16;In the acid bath the acid coagulates and solidifies the filaments now known as regenerated cellulose filaments,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;17;After being bathed in acid the filaments are ready to be spun into yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;18;Depending on the type of yarn desired several spinning methods can be used including Pot Spinning Spool Spinning and Continuous Spinning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;19;In Pot Spinning the filaments are first stretched under controlled tension onto a series of offsetting rollers called godet wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;20; This stretching reduces the diameter of the filaments and makes them more uniform in size and it also gives the filaments more strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;21;The filaments are then put into a rapidly spinning cylinder called a Topham Box resulting in a cakelike strings that stick to the sides of the Topham Box,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;22;The strings are then washed bleached rinsed dried and wound on cones or spools,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;23;Spool Spinning is very similar to Pot Spinning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rayon;24;The filaments are passed through rollers and wound on spools where they are washed bleached rinsed dried and wound again on spools or cones,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;25;In Continuous Spinning the filaments are washed bleached dried twisted and wound at the same time that they are stretched over godet wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;26;Once the fibers are sufficiently cured they are ready for posttreatment chemicals and the various weaving processes necessary to produce the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;27;The resulting fabric can then be given any of a number of finishing treatments,Relevant
MadeHow;Rayon;28;These include calendaring to control smoothness fire resistance preshrinking water resistance and wrinkle resistance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;1;Pieces of sheet metal are either welded or clinched together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;2;Clinching is a process closely resembling stapling in that the two pieces are crimped together under pressure though no additional pieces such as staples are added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;3;If the part of the cabinet is to be visible it will be welded and ground down to appear as one piece,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;4;The extent to which the welding process is automated depends on the company and the number of refrigerators being produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;5;If the sheet metal was not purchased in precoated form it is now painted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;6;Some manufacturers use spray equipment to lay a uniform coat of paint on the metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;7;Others dip the parts in a paintsolvent mixture before heating them to bake the paint onto the surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;8;The inner cabinet is sometimes made from sheet metal very similar to the outer shell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;9;Any seams are caulked to improve insulation and looks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;10;Some manufacturers and some models use plastic for inner liners for example the inner door is almost exclusively made from plastic today,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;11;The plastic liners are vacuum formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;12;In this process a thick piece of plastic slightly larger than the finished part has its outer edges clamped and is then heated,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;13;The hot plastic is next pulled by vacuum into a mold and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;14;After trimming the resulting part is ready for assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;15;The inner cabinet is inserted into the outer cabinet and the two are snapped together before the fixtures are inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;16;Some tubes and wires are run through the gap between the two before it is filled with insulation,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;17;A dispensing device (sometimes robotically operated sometimes a manually operated long gun) inserts foam between the walls,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;18;When heated in an oven this foam expands to add rigidity and insulation to the cabinet,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;19;A similar process is used for the doors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;20;The refrigeration components are attached to the cabinet using screws and clips,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;21;The tubing is soldered together and a protective coating is sprayed on the joints,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;22;The order of this assembly varies between manufacturers and models,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;23;The copper tubing from which the coils (condensers and evaporators) have separately been cut bent and soldered is then attached to the refrigerator as a unit,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;24;The seal on the refrigerator door is created by means of magnet laden gaskets that are attached to the doors with screws,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;25;Handles and hinges are also screwed onto the door before its hinges are screwed onto the cabinet,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;26;Some adjustment is allowed for proper operation of the door,Relevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;27;Most manufacturers mix testing with manufacturing from this point on,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;28;The unit is leak tested with nitrogen (a safe gas that makes up about 79 percent of the air) if it passes it is charged with refrigerant and subjected to further testing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;29;Next the accessories (shelves crispers ice trays etc) are added and taped down for shipping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Refrigerator;30;The unit is given a final look and then packaged for shipping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;1;The major components of most revolvers begin as a group of steel or stainless steel blanks that are forged into close approximations of the desired parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;2;The basic shape of each part is formed by placing a heated blank of material into a forging press and impacting it with several hundred tons of force,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;3;This impact forces the metal into the forging die a steel block with a cavity shaped like the part being produced,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;4;Sometimes multiple strikes by the press are required each with a more precise die than the previous step,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;5;The resulting part is both extremely strong and very similar to final shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;6;After forging the flow patterns of the metal must be stabilized by heat treating,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;7;This procedure consists of reheating the parts in a controlled atmosphere to relieve internal stresses without reducing the metals inherent strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;8;Machining can now begin on the frame cylinder and other component parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;9;Most modern revolvers are manufactured on automated computercontrolled machining centers and lathes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;10;However a number of manufacturers have had such excellent service and results with some of their machines that they continue to utilize fiftyyearold equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;11;Regardless of whether older or modern equipment is used the basic process actions of milling drilling and tapping are essentially the same,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;12;The tolerances on this machining must be held within one or two thousandths of an inch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;13;All of the components from the screws to the trigger are machined using similar processes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;14;To effectively machine the raw forging a worker clamps it into a holding apparatus that secures the part during machining,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;15;Properly designed fixtures also contain tool guides and bushings to support the cutting tool and increase accuracy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;16;Many of the operations performed will require several specialized fixtures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;17;Cylinders screws shafts and barrels are made on lathes while frames sideplates sights and triggers are made on a milling and machining center,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;18;One of the most unique processes is the rifling of the barrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;19;Rifling is essentially a series of grooves within the barrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;20;These grooves have a precise twist that through contact with the bullet circumference causes the bullet to spin during firing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;21;This rate of twist is about 1 turn in 16 inches (406 centimeters),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;22;To produce the rifling a worker subjects the barrel to either the cutting or the button rifling process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;23;Cutting is accomplished by drawing a broachlike cutting tool through the barrel blank repeatedly removing metal to approximately 010 inch (025 centimeter) deep,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;24;Cutting marks and other scratches within the rifling can impair accuracy by damaging the bullet which throws it out of balance,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;25;However one advantage of these marks is that they are different in every gun barrel producing unique rifling imprints on the bullets they fire,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;26;This is how law enforcement specialists match bullets to the gun that fired them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;27;Button rifling refers to an operation in which a hardened form tool is drawn through the barrel blank under high force displacing the metal in the grooves without cutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;28;This is similar in some respects to the forging operation only it is done without heating the barrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;29;The advantages of button rifling are increased production no chip formation and improved surface quality,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;30;After machining the metal surfaces of most steel or aluminum weapons receive a protective coating to reduce corrosion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;31;Commonly referred to as blueing this process entails submersing the parts in tanks of acid and other chemicals,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;32;In these vats the chemicals react with the metal to produce a durable barrier against the elements,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;33;Chrome and gold plating parkerizing and anodizing (for aluminum) are some variants of the blueing process while plating another means of applying a protective coat is accomplished by setting up an electric current between the parts and the supply anode which consists of another type of metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;34;The electrical path carries molecules of the plating metal to the component where they bond very tightly to the surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;35;The entire weapon is assembled by one person who fits all of the components many of them manually,Relevant
MadeHow;Revolver;36;While dimensional control has improved significantly over the past twenty years the timing of the trigger and hand mechanism and the crispness of the trigger pull are still set by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;37;Most manufacturers have grades of fitting quality for example the trigger pull of a service weapon that will be used by police is set heavier than that of a target or specialty handgun,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;38;One would expect to exert a more determined effort to discharge a weapon in a law enforcement setting while at the target range the lighter trigger pull is desirable to increase accuracy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Revolver;39;Once the weapon has been put together any necessary filing polishing and turning will be performed before testing,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;1;The initial stage of manufacturing the harvested latex usually takes place on the rubber plantation prior to packing and shipping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;2;The first step in processing the latex is purification which entails straining it to remove the other constituent elements apart from rubber and to filter out impurities such as tree sap and debris,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;3;The purified rubber is now collected in large vats,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;4;Combined with acetic or formic acid the rubber particles cling together to form slabs,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;5;Next the slabs are squeezed between rollers to remove excess water and pressed into bales or blocks usually 2 or 3 square feet (6 or 9 square meter) ready for shipping to factories,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;6;The size of the blocks depends on what the individual plantation can accommodate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;7;The rubber is then shipped to a rubber factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;8;Here the slabs are machine cut (or chopped) into small pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;9;Next many manufacturers use a Banbury Mixer invented in 1916 by Femely H Banbury,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;10;This machine mixes the rubber with other ingredients—sulfur to vulcanize it pigments to color it and other chemicals to increase or diminish the elasticity of the resulting rubber bands,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;11;Although some companies dont add these ingredients until the next stage (milling) the Banbury machine integrates them more thoroughly producing a more uniform product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;12;Milling the next phase of production entails heating the rubber (a blended mass if it has been mixed discrete pieces if it has not) and squeezing it flat in a milling machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;13;After the heated flattened rubber leaves the milling machine it is cut into strips,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;14;Still hot from the milling the strips are then fed into an extruding machine which forces the rubber out in long hollow tubes (much as a meat grinder produces long strings of meat),Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;15;Excess rubber regularly builds up around the head of each extruding machine and this rubber is cut off collected and placed back with the rubber going into the milling machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;16;The tubes of rubber are then forced over aluminum poles called mandrels which have been covered with talcum powder to keep the rubber from sticking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;17;Although the rubber has already been vulcanized its rather brittle at this point and needs to be cured before it is elastic and usable,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;18;To accomplish this the poles are loaded onto racks that are steamed and heated in large machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;19;Removed from the poles and washed to remove the talcum powder the tubes of rubber are fed into another machine that slices them into finished rubber bands,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;20;Rubber bands are sold by weight and because they tend to clump together only small quantities can be weighed accurately by machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Rubber Band;21;Generally any package over 5 pounds (22 kilograms) can be loaded by machine but will still require manual weighing and adjusting,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;1;Shoemaking is a laborintensive process and the cost of producing the many components of the running shoe reflect the skilled labor necessary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;2;Each phase of production requires precision and skills and taking shortcuts to reduce costs can result in an inferior shoe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;3;Some running shoes (known as sliplasted shoes) have no insole board,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;4;Instead the singlelayer upper is wrapped around both the top and the bottom portions of the foot,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;5;Most running shoes however consist of an insole board that is cemented to the upper with cement,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;6;This section will focus on cementlasted shoes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;7;First prepared rolls of synthetic material and rolls of dyed split and suede leather (used as part of the foxing) are sent to the factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;8;Next die machines stamp the shoe shapes which are then cut out in cookie cutter fashion with various markings to guide the rest of the assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;9;After being bundled and labeled these pieces are sent to another part of the factory where theyll be stitched,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;10;The pieces that will form the upper part of the shoe are stitched or cemented together and the lace holes punched out,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;11;These pieces include the featherline the vamp the mudguard the throat (with eyestay and lacing section) the tongue reinforcements such as the saddle or arch bandage the collar (with Achilles tendon protector) the foxing and the logo,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;12;At this point the upper looks not like a shoe but like a round hat because there is extra material—called the lasting margin —that will be folded underneath the shoe when it gets cemented to the sole,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;13;Next the insole is stitched to the sides of the upper,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;14;Stiffening agents are then added to the heel region and toe box and an insole board is inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;15;The completed upper is heated and fitted around a last a plastic mold that forms the final shape of the shoe,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;16;An automatic lasting machine then pulls the upper down over the last,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;17;Finally a cement nozzle applies cement between the upper and insole board and the machine presses the two pieces together to bond them,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;18;The upper now has the exact shape of the finished shoe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;19;Prestamped and cutout forms of the midsole and outsole or wedge are layered and cemented to the upper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;20;First the outsole and midsole are aligned and bonded together,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;21;Next the outsole and midsole are aligned with the upper and placed over a heater to reactivate the cement,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;22;As the cement cools the upper and bottom are joined,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;23;The shoe is removed from the last and inspected,Relevant
MadeHow;Running Shoe;24;Any excess cement is scraped off,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;1;After the hide or skin is removed from the animals carcass it is soaked in drums containing lime and other chemicals to loosen the hair and outer layer of the skin,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;2;The inside flesh layer is also removed either by machine or hand with a special knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;3;The remaining hide is soaked in lime and bacteria solutions to remove residue,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;4;Next the hair is removed either by machine or manually with a special knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;5;The hide is soaked again this time in an acid solution in order to remove the lime left by the previous soakings,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;6;Because it is important that the fleshy side is left smooth with no loose fibers the hide undergoes a final treatment called scudding which involves hanging the hide over a beam and removing any bits of remaining hair tissue and dirt with a blunt knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;7;The hide is then thoroughly washed,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;8;To prevent hides from decaying they are immersed in a diluted solution of tanning acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;9;Over several months they are gradually treated with stronger solutions,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;10;Oil tanning or chamoising is still used sometimes by rubbing animal or fish grease into the hide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;11;At this point the leather has two sides the flesh side and the grain side,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;12;The hides are now given to a currier who manually rubs a mixture of tallow cod oil and other greases plus wax into the leather over a period of time,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;13;This process gives the leather color makes it flexible durable and waterproof,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;14;The most common and popular colors for saddles are golden yellow also known as the London color and Havana which is of a darker shade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;15;Warwick a much darker color that turns black with use is applied in the making of frizzing harness as opposed to riding tack,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;16;(This color is produced by staining with aniline dye),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;17;The currier then allows the hides to mature for several weeks,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;18;There are two basic saddle tree designs the rigid and spring tree both of which can accommodate either a straight or dipped seat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;19;The modern English saddle usually has a spring tree while the Western saddle has a rigid tree,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;20;The spring tree is first shaped out of thin plywood,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;21;Fiberglass material (the fiberglass looks like a white screen mesh) is then stretched over this plywood and liquid resin is handbrushed or sprayed on top resulting in a very strong and durable product,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;22;Two springs made of lightweight steel strips are then inserted under the tree running from front to the rear along the widest part of the seat and set about two inches (five centimeters) from the outside,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;23;The springs provide greater comfort and more flexibility to the rider by allowing the pressure exerted through the seat bones to be transmitted to the horse,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;24;The rigid saddle tree is made by molding it out of fiberglass by combining wood shavings with resin in a mold under pressure or by creating a wooden tree around which wet leather strips are wrapped and allowed to dry,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;25;To reinforce the saddle tree steel plates are placed underneath the tree from the pommel (the head) to the cantle (the rear part of the saddle which projects upward),Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;26;The steel plates are secured above and below the pommel at the head and gullet of the tree,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;27;The stirrup bars are attached next,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;28;A prongline metal bracket measuring three inches wide is bolted onto the tree below the head on the point of the tree (the forwardmost point of the saddle),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;29;Bars are made of two pieces the bar itself and a movable catch or thumb piece which is set into the bar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;30;This catch works on the premise that it can be opened when the stirrup leather is put in position and will in theory open and release the leather if the rider should fall,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;31;The bars are always forged (hammered or squeezed into the proper shape) or cast (put into a liquid state and forced into a shaped mold) and the word forged or cast is always stamped on the bar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;32;A typical saddle includes a seat for the rider skirts panels and flaps that protect the horse from the riders legs and vice versa a girth that fits around the stomach of the horse and keeps the saddle stable and stirrups for the riders feet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;33;Drings are used to hold items such as canteens or ropes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;34;A typical saddle includes a seat for the rider skirts panels and flaps that protect the horse from the riders legs and vice versa a girth that fits around the stomach of the horse and keeps the saddle stable and stirrups for the riders feet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;35;Drings are used to hold items such as canteens or ropes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;36;The stirrup leathers about 78 inch (22 centimeters) wide are made from read leather cowhide rawhide or buffalo hide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;37;They go over the top of the bar and back down to the stirrups,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;38;A strong muslin cloth is placed over the tree from the pommel to the cantle to form a foundation,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;39;Pitch paint is then applied to waterproof it,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;40;Next strips of white serge a woolen material are stretched and fastened tightly with small nails from the head of the tree at the pommel to the cantle,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;41;Stretch canvas is then positioned over the serge and nailed in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;42;This forms the base of the seat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;43;Small pieces of shaped felt and leather (called bellies) are placed on the edges of the tree at the broadest part of the seat so that when the seat is eventually made it will not drop away at the edges,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;44;A piece of serge is then tightly stretched and stitched down to the canvas layer to make the shape of the seat,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;45;Next a small slit is made so that the space between the serge and canvas can be lightly stuffed with wool to give the seat resilience and to prevent the tree itself being felt through the leather seat,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;46;Pigskin is now dampened and stretched tightly and is then stretched over the seat,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;47;(The pigskin is dampened and stretched so that when it dries and shrinks a neat and tight final product will be achieved),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;48;The under panel which protects the horse from the girths is stitched and nailed into place on the tree,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;49;The under panel is usually made of pigskin leather or grained cowhide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;50;Girth straps are attached to the saddle next,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;51;Made of soft leather these straps are very short,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;52;Attached to them are the girths whose purpose is to hold the saddle firmly in place by fastening them around the horses belly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;53;These girths are made in 78inch or oneinch (254 centimeters) thick sizes and they can range in length from 36 inches (9144 centimeters) for a tiny pony to 54 inches (137 centimeters) for a large horse (these measurements include the buckles),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;54;Girths are made of soft leather mohair or nylon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;55;The outer panels made of leather are stuffed with felt wool or plastic foam and are covered in either leather serge or linen,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;56;They are attached underneath the saddle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saddle;57;Leather skirts are then sewn just above the outer panel,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;58;Drings (also known as tiedowns) are now attached to the saddle,Relevant
MadeHow;Saddle;59;Usually about one inch wide the Drings are made of rawhide and have strings attached to them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;1;The salsa manufacturer purchases fresh frozen or dehydrated produce such as tomatoes peppers and onions from growers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;2;Other ingredients such as vinegar tomato paste spices or additives are purchased from manufacturers in processed form,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;3;The tomatoes are first inspected then peeled using lye,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;4;The stems seeds and any residual skin are then removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;5;Some salsa manufacturers roast their green chili peppers before washing them,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;6;Next the stem seeds and calyx are removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;7;The chili peppers are then blanched and the pH value or acid count is adjusted using citric acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;8;All other produce is cleaned by passing the vegetables through tanks of water or by spraying under high water pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;9;The inedible parts of these vegetables (such as garlic peel stems or onion skins) are removed by processing machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;10;The vegetables are then cut using standard machines that are preset to the desired level of fineness,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;11;To make chunky salsa the vegetables are usually diced while the fresh cilantro is minced,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;12;To make smoother salsa all the vegetables are processed to the same consistency as the tomatoes,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;13;Most salsa is not fresh due to longdistance transport of the product from manufacturing plants to retail outlets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;14;Because it is important for the product to have a long shelflife heating the salsa is necessary to prohibit the growth of mold within the container before purchase,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;15;Most salsa however is minimally processed,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;16;The tomato paste or processed tomatoes water vinegar and spices are placed in a premix kettle that is large enough to hold several batches of salsa,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;17;This mixture is then placed in a batch kettle along with the other ingredients such as onions and chili peppers,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;18;Salsa may be slow or fast cooked or in the case of fresh salsa steam cooked,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;19;Cooking time and temperature vary the slow method subjects the salsa to a low temperature of 163 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) for 45 minutes while the fast method subjects the salsa to a high temperature of 253 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) for 30 seconds under pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;20;After cooking the salsa is ladled into glass jars plastic bottles or other containers that are usually made from heatresistant polyethylene or polypropylene,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;21;Fresh salsa is placed into the container cold and then steam heated while cooked salsa is placed into the container while it is still warm,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;22;The machine that fills the containers does so by volume,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salsa;23;The jars or containers are then sealed and cooled in cold water or air,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;24;This process vacuumseals the product because the heated salsa cools and contracts producing a partial vacuum under the seal,Relevant
MadeHow;Salsa;25;Jars and plastic containers that are not preprinted with product information are labeled and then packed in corrugated cardboard boxes to be shipped to stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;1;A typical sanding belt originates with the manufacture of a large roll of coated abrasive containing an X weight cotton fabric backing 100 grit aluminum oxide and resin bond,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;2;Production starts when the make coat is applied to one side of the backing material,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;3;The next step applying the abrasive mineral is the most important in the manufacturing process because it determines the orientation and density of the mineral,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;4;In the past the backing with the first layer of adhesive passed under a controlled stream of abrasive which applied a thin layer of randomly oriented grit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;5;Today the backing is passed adhesive side down over a pan of abrasives that have been electrostatically charged—given an electric charge opposite to the backing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;6;The opposite charge causes the abrasive to adhere evenly to the backing resulting in a very sharp fastcutting coated abrasive tool with the maximum life possible,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;7;Controlling mineral density on the flexible backing gives rise to two important variations in product design openand closedcoat abrasives,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;8;An opencoat product contains abrasives grains that cover from 50 to 70 percent of the surface area of the backing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;9;This lower density allows the finished product to be flexible and prevents it from clogging or loading with bits of work material,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;10;In closedcoat products the mineral covers 100 percent of the available surface area making the finished products better for finishing applications and more suitable for rougher handling than opencoat products,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;11;Once the grain has been imbedded in the make coat the roll is dried and moved on for application of the size coat,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;12;Following application of the size coat the roll is dried again and cured under carefully controlled temperature and humidity conditions,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;13;The finished product is then wound on a large spool and shipped to the companies that will convert it into sanding belts or other items,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;14;Additional materials and processes may be included to give the converted product special characteristics,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;15;One such treatment is the addition of a grinding aid in the size coat that improves grinding of some metals in highpressure applications,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;16;Another treatment entails applying a pressuresensitive adhesive to the nonabrasive side of the backing to make some types of sanding disks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;17;Material may be also added to reduce the static electricity that is generated when a belt is used on wood,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;18;Passing the roll through two closely spaced steel rollers in a process called satining crushes protruding minerals and leaves a product with uniform thickness designed for fine finishing applications,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;19;Before the coated abrasive roll is converted into a belt or other product it is systematically flexed or bent to break the continuous layer of adhesive bond,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;20;This flexing is necessary because the freshly manufactured roll is so stiff that it otherwise would not perform properly when converted into other products,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;21;Flexing can be applied in either a single direction or in multiple directions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;22;Single direction flexing breaks the bond usually at a 90 degree angle to the edge of the roll,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;23;For special applications in which the belt must accurately conform to contours of a part surface single direction flexing is applied along lines parallel to the sides of the belt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;24;Multiple flexing breaks the bond at 45 degree angles to the sides of the belt in a crisscross pattern or in a combination of 90 degree and 45 degree directions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;25;Although the latter produces a very flexible belt such flexing greatly reduces the useful life of the product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;26;Converting roll material into abrasive belts starts with cutting strips of coated abrasives to the desired width,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;27;Each strip is then cut to the proper length and the ends are joined together,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;28;The joint in common belts is an overlapping splice at 45 degrees,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;29;Narrow belts are spliced at a more acute angle and wide belts at a greater angle,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;30;A variety of splicing techniques can be applied depending upon the importance of changes in belt thickness at the slice and the amount of stress the belt will receive during use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;31;One common practice in preparing a splice for joining is skiving a process that removes a layer of abrasive or backing from the ends of the belt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;32;To minimize thickness of joints in products used for finishing applications both ends are skived,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;33;Coarsegrained products which are used for less precise applications are skived on one end only,Relevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;34;Conversion of other products proceeds similarly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sandpaper;35;For example sanding disks begin with a properly sized section of roll material and a machine punches out the individual disks complete with the hole in the center,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;1;To make fiberglass suitable for dish manufacture a sheet molding compound mixture that includes reflective metallic material and ultraviolet scattering compositions is mixed with resin calcium carbonate and a catalyst cure,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;2;This mixture forms a paste that is poured onto a sheet of polyethylene film that has fiberglass added in chopped form,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;3;The result is a sheet layered with the compound paste fiberglass and the polyethylene film,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;4;This sheet is then pressed at 89 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) to mature,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;5;To shape the sheet into the desired parabolic shape it is pressed at high pressure (of 14002200 metric tons),Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;6;The dish is then trimmed cooled and painted,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;7;After the paint has dried the dish is packed for shipment in sturdy boxes,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;8;For metallic dishes the common metal of choice is aluminum,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;9;This type of dish can be assembled in sections called petals or all at once,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;10;An aluminum plate is perforated with a punching die creating tiny holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;11;The size of these holes are contingent on the manufacturers preference,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;12;Larger holes mean greater loss of the signal so fairly small holes are selected,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;13;Another factor in the selection of hole size is the power of the broadcasting satellite,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;14;Newer more powerful satellites require a hole size that is approximately half that required for older less powerful satellites,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;15;The newly perforated aluminum plate is then heated stretched over a mold cooled and trimmed,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;16;A paint powder coating for protection is then applied using an electrostatic charge in which the paint is given an opposite electrical charge from the plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;17;The dish or petal is then heated to melt the powder and seal the paint on,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;18;The petals are usually sealed together with ribs in the factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;19;Although some current home satellite dishes are very small—only about 3 feet in diameter—manufacturers have begun to introduce even smaller dishes that have a diameter of only 18 inches and can fit on a window sill or a porch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;20;Mesh petals are made from aluminum that is extruded—forced into a die of the proper shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;21;They are usually joined together on site by sliding them into aluminum ribs that attach to the hub and then securing them with metal pins,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;22;All dishes when complete will have the necessary equipment (the feed horn the amplifier etc) installed in the factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;24;When the dish has been set up at the local dealer it is transported to the site location on a open trailer,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;25;Satellite dishes can be installed either by professionals or by the purchaser with assistance from the retailer if necessary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;26;The method selected depends upon the size of the dish and the mechanical expertise of the purchaser,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;27;An installation site reasonably clear of obstructions not more than 246 feet (75 meters) from the house is selected,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;28;Site selection is also contingent on local building codes and the possibility of microwave interference from radio and television towers in the vicinity,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;29;Once a site is selected the base must be installed first,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;30;The base of most satellite dishes consists of a concrete foundation that extends below the frost line,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;31;A clayey soil is excellent while sandy or rocky soil requires more concrete,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;32;A base tube filled with concrete is then set into the concrete foundation,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;33;Some satellite dishes require a slab mount installation a method considered to be more stable than typical base construction,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;34;In some cases slab mount installation is necessary since the site selected for the placement of the satellite dish is unstable,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;35;The slab is generally 16 feet (5 meter) square and 32 feet (1 meter) deep,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;39;Soil is excavated to the proper depth and the concrete is poured,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;40;A triangular steel mount fixture is then embedded into the concrete,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;41;Next the pedestal is attached to either the base tube or the triangular steel mount fixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;42;The elevation arm is then attached to the pedestal,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;43;The mounted satellite dish must be aligned in order to point toward the satellite,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;44;The angle at which the dish is eventually situated will vary according to which satellite is selected and at what latitude the dish is located,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;45;Coaxial cables connect the satellite to the receiver that is located in the house near the television,Relevant
MadeHow;Satellite Dish;46;A trench must be dug for these cables which are placed into a pipe before being buried,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;1;Making a flattip or slotted screwdriver is not very different than making any other configuration,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;2;Variations between a flattip and a Phillips screwdriver will be discussed later in this entry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;3;First coils of green wire (wire that has not yet been drawn to final size) are delivered to a factory in large coils some as heavy as 3000 pounds (1362 kilograms),Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;4;The wire is usually about 375 inch (95 centimeter) in diameter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;5;The wire is then machinedrawn to the diameter necessary for the production run one adjustable drawing machine can produce any required diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;6;In drawing wire is fed through a die with a reducing aperture until it assumes the proper size,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;7;After the wire is drawn it is annealed (heat treated) to obtain the correct tensile strength in the metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;8;This process involves baking the wire at a temperature of about 1350 degrees Fahrenheit (732 degrees Celsius) for 12 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;9;Next the wire is straightened by a string forge and then transferred to a cold forming press which cuts the wire to the appropriate length and forms the tip of the screwdriver and the wings that will fit into the handle,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;10;These wings can be seen through a clear or semiclear plastic handle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;11;The newly formed bar (the actual screwdriver without Ats handle) is then heat treated in an inline furnace at approximately 1555 degrees Fahrenheit (846 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;12;This is a continuous flow process and as the bars come through the furnace they fall into an oil quench for cooling,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;13;The bars are then placed in a draw back oven (450 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit or 232 to 259 degrees Celsius) and baked to a specified hardness,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;14;Consumer model screwdrivers are nickelplated—covered with a protective coating of nickel—before assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;15;If the screwdriver is designated for professional use it is transferred to a handgrinding department where the tip is ground to size,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;16;The shank is chemically milled and then polished,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;17;The screwdriver then goes to a nickel flash bath and is electrically chrome plated,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;18;After the cold forming press (step #3 above) cuts the wire the screwdriver is sent to a swage and grind operation where dies form blades for the tip from the heated wire,Relevant
MadeHow;Screwdriver;19;The tool is then ground and the wings are formed,Relevant

MadeHow;Seismograph;1;A site might interest a seismologist for a number of reasons,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Seismograph;2;The most obvious one is that the region is earthquakeprone perhaps because it is adjacent to a fault or fracture in the earths crust,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Shaving Cream;8;The second phase of manufacture begins when the mixture has cooled to about 152 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Shaving Cream;9;Most of the remaining ingredients—water glycerin and triethanolamine—are added now and mixing continues for approximately 40 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Shaving Cream;10;When the mixture reaches a temperature of 125 to 134 degrees Fahrenheit (50 to 55 degrees Celsius) perfumes or other scents can be added,Relevant

MadeHow;Solar Cell;14;From the boule silicon wafers are sliced one at a time using a circular saw whose inner diameter cuts into the rod or many at once with a multiwire saw,Relevant
MadeHow;Solar Cell;15;(A diamond saw produces cuts that are as wide as the wafer— 5 millimeter thick),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Solar Cell;16;Only about onehalf of the silicon is lost from the boule to the finished circular wafer—more if the wafer is then cut to be rectangular or hexagonal,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Stainless Steel;22;However such a heat treatment—also known as age hardening —requires careful control for even small changes from the recommended temperature time or cooling rate can seriously affect the properties,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;23;Lower aging temperatures produce high strength with low fracture toughness while highertemperature aging produces a lower strength tougher material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;24;Though the heating rate to reach the aging temperature (900 to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit or 482 to 537 degrees Celsius) does not effect the properties the cooling rate does,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;25;A postaging quenching (rapid cooling) treatment can increase the toughness without a significant loss in strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;26;One such process involves water quenching the material in a 35degree Fahrenheit (16degree Celsius) icewater bath for a minimum of two hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;27;The type of heat treatment depends on the type of steel in other words whether it is austenitic ferritic or martensitic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;28;Austenitic steels are heated to above 1900 degrees Fahrenheit (1037 degrees Celsius) for a time depending on the thickness,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Stainless Steel;60;A mirror finish is produced by polishing with progressively finer abrasives followed by extensive buffing,Relevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;61;For grinding or polishing grinding wheels or abrasive belts are normally used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stainless Steel;62;Buffing uses cloth wheels in combination with cutting compounds containing very fine abrasive particles in bar or stick forms,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Stapler;1;While staplers are produced for a number of different uses and in just as many sizes the basic principles behind the workings of each remain the same and the chief components (springs stampings rivets moldings and pins) once completed are assembled to create similar finished products,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;2;Two types of springs are used in the basic stapler the coil and the leaf,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;3;A coil spring is made from metal that has the ability to withstand a constant pressure and release and still maintain its shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;4;The coil spring material is wound around an appropriately sized rod (similar to winding a thin wire around a pencil) and is then heattreated to a produce changes in the metals characteristics—changes that give the metal elasticity,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;5;The heattreated coil spring can be pulled apart and pressed together within reason and still return to its original wound up condition ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;6;A good example of a coil spring is the follow spring which connects the case to the follow block —the metal piece in the magazine that holds the staples toward one end of the magazine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;7;The parts of a stapler are formed in various ways before coming together to form the finished item ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;8;Coil springs such as the follow spring are wound around rods and heattreated while leaf springs such as the clearing spring are rolled or bent to their proper shape ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;9;Sheet metal parts such as the head and base are typically stamped between a punch and die while plastic parts can be injection molded ,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;10;Leaf springs which resemble a diving board are typically made by either bending or rolling (slightly curling) a thin piece of steel and then carefully heating it to a temperature that will cause internal stresses ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;11;Thinly slicing a carrot lengthwise into strips and then placing them in ice water causes the strips to curl up this is the same effect observed when springs are properly heattreated ,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;12;The steel maintains either a curled or flat position and resists any bending motion applied to it ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;13;One example of a leaf spring is the clearing spring the part on the underside of the stapler that allow you to unlatch the base from the upper assembly (the magazine and metal head) ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;14;Stampings are typically made of flat sheet metal material of varying thicknesses that are sandwiched between a punch and die ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;15;When the punch pushes on the material it shears a piece of material (the shape of the punch) out of the sheet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;16;A similar principle is applied when using a cookie cutter on rolledout dough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;17;Stamping material can also be in the form of a coil of material that looks something like a roll of paper towel,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;18;(The material type and thickness depends on the configuration of the part being made),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;19;The coil allows automatic feeding of the material across a punch and die using a coil feeder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;20;The coil is gradually unwound as parts are stamped out of it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;21;This is a very costefficient way of mass producing stampings because it does not require an operator to hold the material between the punch and die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;22;Most of the major metal components besides springs and rivets such as the base metal head and anvil are made in this way,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;23;The pins stampings and springs are subassembled in stages and then assembled together with the upper and lower halves of the stapler frame,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Stapler;26;If the shape is an intricate one another type of punch and die is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;27;The material may also be heated in order to soften it allowing the material to bend more easily,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;28;Most stapler parts have somewhat square corners so typically the material is bent at 90 degree angles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;29;There are now machines that perform stamping and brake forming processes during the same operation they simultaneously punch out shapes and bend them to make the appropriate parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;30;This eliminates the amount of setups and different machines required to make all of the parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;31;A rivet is usually made of a fairly strong steel material but it must also have some elasticity,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;32;A rivet is designed to hold parts in place just like a screw and nut except that the rivet is one piece and cannot be easily disassembled,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;33;One end typically has a head on it (like a nail or a screw) and the other end is usually hollow (either partially or along the whole length),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;34;Rivets are made by cutting off a piece of bar stock and forging it to obtain the desired configuration,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;35;Forging is a process similar to stamping except that the starting material is almost to size already,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;36;Forging will minimally change the size and shape the strength of the material however is significantly increased,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;37;Plastic parts of staplers are made by injection molding in which a liquified plastic is injected into a die,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;38;The liquid flows into the open void and is then cooled,Relevant

MadeHow;Stapler;40;The die is opened and the part is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;41;The pin is little more than a piece of bar stock cut off to a certain length either with a saw or on a machining center,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;42;Because the pin is used as a hinge point for the top and bottom half of the stapler it is usually made from a strong heattreatable metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;43;As required to prevent rust or for cosmetic reasons some of the components are painted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;44;The parts are hung on small racks set on a conveyor and passed by a spray nozzle,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;45;Some automatic painting operations employ electrostatic spraying wherein the parts and paint are electrically charged,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;46;The paint and the parts are given opposite charges—for instance the paint will be given a negative charge while the part will be given a positive charge—because opposite electrical charges attract each other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;47;Electrostatic painting ensures that every possible space on the part will be evenly painted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;48;This method also eliminates wasted paint (overspray),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stapler;49;The pins stampings and springs are subassembled in stages and then assembled together with the upper and lower halves of the stapler frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;50;For the bottom subassembly consisting of the base hanger anvil and clearing spring the parts are placed in an assembly jig that holds them in position to allow the rivets to be placed in the correct holes,Relevant

MadeHow;Stapler;53;The top and bottom halves come together in another jig and the pin that connects the two is riveted into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Stapler;54;Finally the finishing touches such as the feet (antiskid rubber pads) and the plastic cap are then snapped on,Relevant

MadeHow;Stethoscope;3;Stethoscopes are rarely custommade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;4;If there is a large volume sold to one customer the manufacturer can make a certain specified color or put the name of the hospital onto the stethoscopes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;5;Aluminum is typically die cast,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;6;In this process pressured molten aluminum is injected into molds forming a slug in the form of a crude binaural piece or chestpiece,Relevant

MadeHow;Stethoscope;8;Stainless steel arrives in huge rods that are machined on lathes using a semiautomatic process,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;9;Brass is also machined before being sent out for electroplating,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;10;The machining process consists of cutting excess metal from the slug or rod according to a plan that will yield a correctly shaped binaural piece or chestpiece,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;11;The binaural piece is then threaded at the top for the earplugs and barbs are cut into the bottom to allow for the tubing connection,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;12;The chestpiece is also barbed at the top to allow for the connection,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;13;The metal springs are then connected and sealed to the binaural pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;14;More expensive stethoscopes have tubing that is dipped,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;15;The binaural pieces are repeatedly dipped into a liquid latex until the tubes are of the correct thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;16;Tubes intended for inexpensive or disassembled models are molded or extruded using standard methods,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;17;To attach the separate tubing it is first heated by placing it in warm water next it is pushed onto the binaural pieces wrapping snugly around the barbs,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;18;Another lesscommon method of attaching the tubing is to place the binaural pieces in a mold and then place the tubing around them to form a seal,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;19;Stethoscopes are hand assembled,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;20;Once the binaural pieces have tubes the diaphragm is placed in the chestpiece and sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;21;Next the antichill ring is put on both sides of the chestpiece,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;22;This can be done by cutting a recess in a circular track around the rim and slipping the ring inside,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;23;The preferred method is to stretch the ring around the rim of the diaphragm or bell making a secure fit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;24;The earplugs are then screwed on,Relevant
MadeHow;Stethoscope;25;Inexpensive stethoscopes which may be disassembled are placed in bags and sealed,Relevant

MadeHow;Stethoscope;29;The medical supply dealers then provide stethoscopes to private practice hospitals medical supply stores and drug stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;1;Sugarcane requires an average temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit (239 degrees Celsius) and uniform rainfall of about 80 inches (203 centimeters) per year,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;2;Therefore it is grown in tropical or subtropical areas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;3;In the United States harvesting of both cane and sugar beet is done primarily by machine although in some states it is also done by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;4;The harvested cane stalks and beets are loaded mechanically into trucks or railroad cars and taken to mills for processing into raw sugar,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;5;Once there they are cleaned washed milled to extract juice filtered and purified,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;6;The result is a clear sugarfilled juice,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;7;Sugarcane takes about seven months to mature in a tropical area and about 1222 months in a subtropical area,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;8;At this time fields of sugarcane are tested for sucrose and the most mature fields are harvested first,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;9;In Florida Hawaii and Texas standing cane is fired to burn off the dry leaves,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;10;In Louisiana the six to tenfeet (18 to 3meter) tall cane stalks are cut down and laid on the ground before burning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;11;In the United States harvesting (of both cane and sugar beet) is done primarily by machine although in some states it is also done by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;12;The harvested cane stalks are loaded mechanically into trucks or railroad cars and taken to mills for processing into raw sugar,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;13;After the cane arrives at the mill yards it is mechanically unloaded and excessive soil and rocks are removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;14;The cane is cleaned by flooding the carrier with warm water (in the case of sparse rock and trash clutter) or by spreading the cane on agitating conveyors that pass through strong jets of water and combing drums (to remove larger amounts of rocks trash and leaves etc),Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;15;At this point the cane is clean and ready to be milled,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;16;When the beets are delivered at the refinery they are first washed and then cut into strips,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;17;Next they are put into diffusion cells with water at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (794 degrees Celsius) and sprayed with hot water countercurrently to remove the sucrose,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;18;After being purifed the clear juice undergoes vacuum evaporation to remove most of the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;19;In this process four vacuumboiling cells are arranged in series so that each succeeding cell has a higher vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;20;The vapors from one body can thus boil the juice in the next one a method called multipleeffect evaporation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;21;Next the syrupy solution is vacuumcrystallized to form sugar crystals,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;22;The remaining liquid is removed using centrifugaling and drying and the sugar is packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;23;Two or three heavily grooved crusher rollers break the cane and extract a large part of the juice or swinghammer type shredders (1200 RPM) shred the cane without extracting the juice,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;24;Revolving knives cutting the stalks into chips are supplementary to the crushers,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;25;(In most countries the shredder precedes the crusher),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;26;A combination of two or even all three methods may be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;27;The pressing process involves crushing the stalks between the heavy and grooved metal rollers to separate the fiber (bagasse) from the juice that contains the sugar,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;28;As the cane is crushed hot water (or a combination of hot water and recovered impure juice) is sprayed onto the crushed cane countercurrently as it leaves each mill for diluting,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;29;The extracted juice called vesou contains 95 percent or more of the sucrose present,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;30;The mass is then diffused a process that involves finely cutting or shredding the stalks,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;31;Next the sugar is separated from the cut stalks by dissolving it in hot water or hot juice,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;32;The juice from the mills a dark green color is acid and turbid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;33;The clarification (or defecation) process is designed to remove both soluble and insoluble impurities (such as sand soil and ground rock) that have not been removed by preliminary screening,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;34;The process employs lime and heat as the clarifying agents,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;35;Milk of lime (about one pound per ton of cane) neutralizes the natural acidity of the juice forming insoluble lime salts,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;36;Heating the lime juice to boiling coagulates the albumin and some of the fats waxes and gums and the precipitate formed entraps suspended solids as well as the minute particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;37;The sugar beet solution on the other hand is purified by precipitating calcium carbonate calcium sulfite or both in it repeatedly,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;38;Impurities become entangled in the growing crystals of precipitate and are removed by continuous filtration,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;39;The muds separate from the clear juice through sedimentation,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;40;The nonsugar impurities are removed by continuous filtration,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;41;The final clarified juice contains about 85 percent water and has the same composition as the raw extracted juice except for the removed impurities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;42;To concentrate this clarified juice about twothirds of the water is removed through vacuum evaporation,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;43;Generally four vacuumboiling cells or bodies are arranged in series so that each succeeding body has a higher vacuum (and therefore boils at a lower temperature),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;44;The vapors from one body can thus boil the juice in the next one—the steam introduced into the first cell does what is called multipleeffect evaporation,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;45;The vapor from the last cell goes to a condenser,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;46;The syrup leaves the last body continuously with about 65 percent solids and 35 percent water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;47;The sugar beet sucrose solution at this point is also nearly colorless and it likewise undergoes multipleeffect vacuum evaporation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;48;The syrup is seeded cooled and put in a centrifuge machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;49;The finished beet crystals are washed with water and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;50;Crystallization is the next step in the manufacture of sugar,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;51;Crystallization takes place in a singlestage vacuum pan,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;52;The syrup is evaporated until saturated with sugar,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;53;As soon as the saturation point has been exceeded small grains of sugar are added to the pan or strike,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;54;These small grains called seed serve as nuclei for the formation of sugar crystals (Seed grain is formed by adding 56 ounces [1600 grams] of white sugar into the bowl of a slurry machine and mixing with 33 parts of a liquid mixture 70 percent methylated spirit and 30 percent glycerine The machine runs at 200 RPM for 15 hours) Additional syrup is added to the strike and evaporated so that the original crystals that were formed are allowed to grow in size The growth of the crystals continues until the pan is full When sucrose concentration reaches the desired level the dense mixture of syrup and sugar crystals called massecuite is discharged into large containers known as crystallizers Crystallization continues in the crystallizers as the massecuite is slowly stirred and cooled 10 Massecuite from the mixers is allowed to flow into centrifugals where the thick syrup or molasses is separated from the raw sugar by centrifugal force 11 The highspeed centrifugal action used to separate the massecuite into raw sugar crystals and molasses is done in revolving machines called centrifugals A centrifugal machine has a cylindrical basket suspended on a spindle with perforated sides lined with wire cloth inside which are metal sheets containing 400 to 600 perforations per square inch The basket revolves at speeds from 1000 to 1800 RPM The raw sugar is retained in the centrifuge basket because the perforated lining retains the sugar crystals The mother liquor or molasses passes through the lining (due to the centrifugal force exerted) The final molasses (blackstrap molasses) containing sucrose reducing sugars organic nonsugars ash and water is sent to large storage tanks Once the sugar is centrifuged it is cut down and sent to a granulator for drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;55;In some countries sugarcane is processed in small factories without the use of centrifuges and a darkbrown product (noncentrifugal sugar) is produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;56;Centrifugal sugar is produced in more than 60 countries while noncentrifugal sugar in about twenty countries,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sugar;57;Damp sugar crystals are dried by being tumbled through heated air in a granulator,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;58;The dry sugar crystals are then sorted by size through vibrating screens and placed into storage bins,Relevant
MadeHow;Sugar;59;Sugar is then sent to be packed in the familiar packaging we see in grocery stores in bulk packaging or in liquid form for industrial use,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;1;CAs are produced in heated kettles that can hold from a few gallons to several thousand gallons the size depends upon the scale of the particular manufacturing operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;2;1 The initial ingredient is ethyl cyanoacetate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;3;Placed into a glasslined kettle with revolving mixing blades this material is then mixed with formaldehyde,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;4;The mixing of the two chemicals triggers condensation a chemical reaction that produces water that is then evaporated as the kettle is heated,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;5;When the water has evaporated what remains in the kettle is the CA polymer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;6;The separated monomers are piped to a second kette,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;7;In going from one vessel to the other the monomers move through a series of cooling coils that allow them to become liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;8;The contents of the second collecting container (the one holding the liquid monomers) are effectively the CA glue although they still need to be proteed against curing,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;9;Various chemicals called free radical inhibitors and base scavengers are added to precipitate out impurities that would otherwise harden the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;10;After receiving any necessary additives the glue is packaged accordingly,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;11;2 Because the CA will begin to cure or harden on contact with any moisture the kettle space left empty by the evaporation of the water is filled with a nonreactive gas such as nitrogen,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;12;3 Next the kettle is heated to a temperature of approximately 305 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;13;Heating the mixture causes thermal cracking of the polymer creating reactive monomers (chemically ethyl cyanoacrylate esters with a slightly different process methyl cyanoacrylate esters are possible) that will when the finished glue is applied recombine to form a bond,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;14;4 Because the monomers are lighter than the polymer they volatize upward and are piped out of the kettle into a second collector,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;15;The process is not unlike distilling although the goal is a glue rather than an alcoholic beverage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;16;In going from one vessel to the other the monomers move through a series of cooling coils that allow them to become liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;17;A second distilling might be performed for a highquality product and some manufacturers might even distill the monomers a third time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;18;5 The contents of the second collecting container (the one holding the liquid monomers) are effectively the CA glue although they still need to be protected against curing,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;19;Various chemicals called free radical inhibitors and base scavengers are added to precipitate out impurities that would otherwise harden the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;20;Because the quantities of impurities and precipitates are small (measurable in nothing larger than parts per million) there is no need to remove them from the CA Mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;21;If particles of precipitate were visible even under several hundred magnifications it would be a sign of severe contamination and the batch would be destroyed,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;22;6 The CA glue can at this point receive any additives that the manufacturer wishes,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;23;These additives can control the viscosity of the CA (in fact at least three different thicknesses are sold) or they can allow the glue to work on material types that earlier CAs could not,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;24;A thicker viscosity is desired when bonding is to be done on surfaces that dont meet very well the thicker viscosity allows the glue to fill the empty spaces before it sets,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;25;Without other additives CAs might need to be restricted to nonporous surfaces,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;26;With additives in the CA or with some surface preparation the CA will work very well,Relevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;27;CA technology is sufficiently mature that a manufacturer can meet a request from a customer for a CA that will bond almost any given pair of surfaces,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Super Glue;28;7 The CA can now be added to tubes using conventional albeit humidityfree techniques,Relevant

MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;21;In general temperatures above 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius) are considered to be the optimum cooking temperatures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;22;Cooking depends on the characteristics of the corn and the interaction of time temperature lime concentration cooking vessel size and agitation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;23;Nixtamal used for fried products is generally cooked less than nixtamal used for table tortillas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;24;Immediately after cooking the solution is quenched (rapidly cooled) to about 154 to 162 degrees Fahrenheit (6872 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;25;This lower temperature decreases water absorption during the steeping process and the cooking time of the nixtamal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;26;The result is a more consistent masa which absorbs less oil during frying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;27;The grain is then steeped for 8 to 16 hours in the cooking vat (if a vertical cooker was used) or transferred to a holding vat (if a Hamilton steam kettle was used),Relevant

MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;45;The grooves become more shallow as they approach the perimeter of the stone,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;46;The number design and depth of the grooves in the stones vary with the intended product stones carved for the production of table tortillas have more shallow grooves to produce a finer masa whereas coarser masa for tortilla chips comes from deepergrooved stones,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;47;The grinding or milling starts when a screw conveyor at the base of the hopper forces the nixtamal through a center opening and into the gap between the stones where shearing occurs,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;48;The material travels outward from the center to the perimeter of the stones,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;49;Water added during milling cools the stones prevents excessive wear and reduces the masa temperature,Relevant

MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;55;This amount of water increases the masa moisture content to the optimum for sheeting,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;56;Like the grinding stones the moisture content depends upon the resulting product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;57;The masa particle size is the result of several interacting factors degree of nixtamal cooking size and depth of the grooves in the grinding stones gap or pressure between the grinding stones amount of water used during milling and the type of corn used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;59;The grinding breaks up the kernel structure and promotes plastic and cohesive properties in the masa,Relevant

MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;82;A threetiered gasfired oven is used to bake the formed masa,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;83;Generally the chips are baked at temperatures ranging from 500 to 554 degrees Fahrenheit (260290 degrees Celsius) with the baking time varying from 35 to 50 seconds,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;84;Baking enhances the alkaline flavor and reduces moisture and oil absorption during frying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;85;The tortilla chips are then cooled by moving through a series of open tiers or cooling racks,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;86;The chips are sometimes cooled for up to 20 minutes before frying to produce a more uniform consistency and to reduce blistering during frying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;87;During this cooling process the chips lose additional moisture (up to 3 percent) and the moisture within each chip becomes more evenly distributed,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;88;The next step involves frying the chips using oil temperatures ranging from 338 to 374 degrees Fahrenheit (170190 degrees Celsius) for 50 to 80 seconds,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;89;The frying temperature and time depend on the type of product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;90;Tortilla chips made from yellow corn require a lower frying temperature and a longer time than chips made from white or blended white and yellow corn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;91;For example corn chips made from yellow corn are fried at 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius) while those made from blended white and yellow corn are fried at temperatures up to 410 degrees Fahrenheit (210 degrees Celsius) for 60 to 90 seconds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;92;Most of the commercial fryers used are the continuous type with direct or indirect heating elements,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;97;The salt and seasonings are applied immediately after frying while the chips are still hot,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;98;The hot chips are conveyed into an inclined rotating cylinder where a liquid seasoning mix is sprayed on them,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;99;Generally the liquid mix consists of hot oil salt seasonings and flavoring and coloring agents,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;100;Upon cooling the oil crystallizes forming the seasoning coat,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;101;Salt can also be deposited on the chips as a liquid spray or by a granulated salt dispenser positioned over the conveying belts after the tumbling operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;102;The amount of salt usually added to tortilla chips is about 1 to 15 percent by weight,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;103;The tortilla chips are then cooled to ambient temperature and immediately packaged in moistureproof bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Tortilla Chip;104;Because fried products are very hygroscopic (they readily absorb and retain moisture) delayed packaging can cause a loss of crispness,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Umbrella;15;The ribs and stretchers are assembled first usually from U shaped or channeled steel or other metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;16;Ribs run underneath the top or canopy of the umbrella stretchers connect the ribs with the shaft of the umbrella,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;17;The ribs are attached to the shaft of the umbrella by fitting into a top notch—a thin round nylon or plastic piece with teeth around the edges and then held with thin wire,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;18;The stretchers are connected to the shaft of the umbrella with a plastic or metal runner the piece that moves along the shaft of the umbrella when it is opened or closed,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;19;Next the ribs and stretchers are connected to each other with a joiner which is usually a small jointed metal hinge as the umbrella is opened or closed the joiner opens or closes through an angle of more than 90 degrees,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;20;There are two catch springs in the shaft of each umbrella these are small pieces of metal that need to be pressed when the umbrella is slid up the shaft to open and again when the umbrella is slid down the shaft for closing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;21;Metal shafts are usually hollow and the catch spring can be inserted while a wood shaft requires that a space for the catch spring be hollowed out,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;22;A pin or other blocking device is usually placed into the shaft a few inches above the upper catch spring to prevent the canopy from sliding past the top of umbrella when the runner goes beyond the upper catch spring,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;23;The cover or canopy of the umbrella is hand sewn in individual panels to the ribs,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;24;Because each panel has to be shaped to the curve of the canopy the cover cannot be cut in one piece,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;25;Panels are sewn at the outer edges of the ribs and there are also connections between the ribs and the panels about onethird of the way down from the outer edge of the canopy,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;26;Each panel is cut separately from piles of materials called gores machine cutting of several layers at once is possible although handcutting is more typical,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;27;The typical rain umbrella has eight panels although some umbrellas with six panels (childrens umbrellas and parasols usually have six panels) and as many as twelve can occasionally be found,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;28;At one point the number of panels in an umbrella may have been an indication of quality (or at least of the amount of attention the umbrella maker paid to his product),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;29;Today because of the quality of the material available to the umbrella maker the number of panels is usually a matter of style and taste rather than quality,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;30;The fabric used in a goodquality umbrella canopy is usually a nylon taffeta rated at 190T (190 threads per inch) with an acrylic coating on the underside and a scotchguard type finish on the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;31;The coating and finish are usually applied by the fabric supplier,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;32;Fabric patterns and designs can be chosen by the manufacturer or the manufacturer might add his own patterns and designs using a rotary or silk screening process especially for a special order of a limited number of umbrellas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;33;Similarly other fabrics besides nylon might be used according to need or taste a patio umbrella attached to an outdoor table does not have to be lightweight and waterproof as much as a customer might want it to be large durable and attractive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;34;The tip of the umbrella that passes through the canopy can be covered with metal (a ferrule) that has been forced over and perhaps glued to the tip or left bare depending on the desire of the manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;35;The handle is connected to the shaft at the end of the process and can be wood plastic metal or any combination of desired ingredients,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;36;Though handles can be screwed on betterquality umbrellas use glue to secure the handle more tightly,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;37;The end tips of the umbrella where the ribs reach past the canopy can be left bare or covered with small plastic or wood end caps that are either pushed or screwed on or glued and then sewn to the ends of the ribs through small holes in the end caps,Relevant
MadeHow;Umbrella;38;Finally the umbrella is packaged accordingly and sent to customers,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;1;The manufacturing process is split into fabrication (making parts) subassembly (putting parts together to make components) and assembly (putting the components together to form the final product),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;2;The fabrication process comprises several different procedures each specific to a particular type of raw material—sheet metal plastic or aluminum,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;3;Once the constituent parts have been made they are assembled major subassemblies or components include the transmission the pump the spin and wash tubs the balance ring and the painted parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;4;Finally the subassemblies are put together inside the shell of the washer which is then complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;5;Most sheet metal parts are formed by a machine called a press,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;6;This name is quite descriptive as the machine actually presses (or squeezes) a piece of sheet metal between two halves of a mold called a die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;7;The metal will take the form of the space between the halves of the die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;8;Because metal in parts shaped by only one die tends to wrinkle crack or tear multiple dies are generally used to form each component,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;9;Where possible the metal is fed directly from a coil into the press,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;10;When this is not possible the metal is cut to length and manually (or with larger parts like the cabinet automatically) placed into the die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;11;Plastic parts are formed in an injection molding machine a metal mold with one or more cavities in the shape of the desired part,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;12;After being heated to its melting point the plastic is forced into the mold under high pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;13;Next water is passed through the mold to cool and solidify the part,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;14;The mold is then opened and the part pushed out by ejector pins,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;15;When you look at a plastic part you often can see small circles created by these pins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;16;Aluminum transmission parts are formed into a rough shape in a die cast machine which works much like an injection mold except that it does not use pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;17;The Most of the key components—transmission motor broke assembly—are housed below the agitator,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;18;The balance ring is a weighted ring that keeps the washer from moving around during operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;19;Molten metal is mechanically ladled into the mold and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;20;The ensuing rough casting is then given its final shape by various machines which drill holes shave excess metal off critical surfaces or cut metal away from the part,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;21;The transmission is assembled manually by workers who bolt snap or press (tight fit) several shafts and gears together,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;22;Workers then add a metered amount of oil and bolt the unit together,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;23;The pump is assembled automatically,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;24;Robots place the impeller and seals in the cover and body and seal the pump,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;25;Some manufacturers use heat and others vibration (which generates heat) as a sealant,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;26;The tub parts are made in presses and the subassembly is manufactured automatically,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;27;After being rolled into a drum shape the side is welded,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;28;The weld is then smoothed out and the drum is placed on a unit called an expander which stretches the tub into its final shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;29;A bottom is then welded onto the drum and this weld is also smoothed,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;30;If the tub is stainless steel it is polished so it wont snag the clothes,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;31;Otherwise the tub is dipped in a solution called a ground coat and heated to about 1600 degrees until this coating hardens,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;32;If the tub will not be visible (the wash tub) the unit is done,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;33;If the tub will be visible (the spin tub) a finish coat is applied following the same procedure used with the ground coat this final coat gives the tub either a white or blue color,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;34;The balance ring is a large weight that stabilizes the washer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;35;Its outside structure is plastic with a ring of metal melted into the plastic for strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;36;Cement is added and balanced precisely,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;37;This ring which weighs more than twenty pounds keeps the machine from walking or moving about when it is in use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;38;Washing machine manufacturers use any one of several painting processes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;39;One manufacturer uses steel that has been prepainted by the steel manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;40;Although cheaper this type of steel does not offer the best rust protection because the cut edges are not painted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;41;Other companies treat their parts with various chemicals to clean and ready them before applying paint,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;42;In some cases the paint comes in a powder with a flourlike consistency,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;43;Mixed with air and given an electrical charge the powder is sprayed on the part which is hung from an overhead conveyor and given an opposite charge so that it and the powder will attract one another,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;44;After spraying the conveyor moves the part into an oven that melts the paint when the part cools the paint process is completed,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;45;This process begins with mounting the transmission on the balance ring,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;46;The transmission is set on a bearing that is bolted on the wash tub the wash tub is sitting on a conveyor,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;47;Another bearing (the lower bearing) the brake assembly and the drive pulley are put on the end of the transmission,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;48;Next a pivoting mechanism called the pivot dome and legs are bolted on the assembly to hold all the pieces together,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;49;Using a hydraulically operated mechanism workers then lift this assembly called the module onto the washer base,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;50;Springs are added to hold module and base together,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;51;A seal is added the spin tub is bolted to the transmission inside of the wash tub and its plastic covers are snapped into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;52;A plastic hub which attaches the agitator to the transmission is bolted onto the output end of the transmission shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;53;Then the agitator is snapped onto the hub,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;54;The pump and a mounting bracket are now bolted onto the motor which is then fitted with a shield to protect against potential leaks,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;55;This assembly is bolted to the base of the washing machine and connected to the transmission module with a belt and hoses,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;56;Next the lid hinges are attached to the lid and the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;57;The top of the washer is bolted to the cabinet with a hinge for easy maintenance,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;58;A mixing valve to control the mixture of hot and cold is bolted to the back of the cabinet,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;59;The graphics panel which provides words and pictures to explain the controls is mounted on the control panel the controls themselves are attached from the back,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;60;The wiring connected as one unit is called a harness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;61;The harness is clipped to the control connectors at one end and the other end is passed through a hole in the top to be mounted to the motor,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;62;Because of its large size and weight the cabinet assembly is then placed in the washer by a robot,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;63;The cabinet is bolted to the base and the controls are snapped together with the mating connectors on the module and motor,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;64;The drain hose is pulled through the cabinet and a part called the gooseneck is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;65;This part is what gives the hose its hook shape so that it will fasten into the drain,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;66;After being tested the front panel is bolted on and a packet of information and accessories is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;67;The finished unit is crated automatically,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;68;A machine opens the cardboard box which was flat for shipment and drops it over the washer,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;69;The top and bottom flaps are simultaneously folded over and glued,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;70;Then the machine applies pressure on the top and bottom of the crate to make sure the glue sets properly,Relevant
MadeHow;Washing Machine;71;After the glue has set the machine puts a banding strap around the top of the crate to add strength for lift truck transportation (the units are carried from the top to reduce the risk of damage),Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;1;This section will focus on quartz digital watches with LED displays,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;2;Although the assembly of such watches must be performed carefully and methodically the most essential aspects of the manufacturing process are in the manufacture of the components,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;3;The heart of a quartz watch is a tiny sliver of quartz,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;4;The synthetically produced quartz is cut by the manufacturer with a diamond saw and shipped to the watchmaker to use,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;5;The production of grown quartz is a critical step in the process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;6;Quartz in a natural form is first loaded into a giant kettle or autoclave (the same device used by doctors and dentists to sterilize instruments),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;7;Hanging from the top of the autoclave are seeds or tiny particles of quartz with the desired crystalline structure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;8;An alkaline material is pumped into the bottom of the autoclave and the autoclave is heated to a temperature of roughly 750 degrees Fahrenheit (400 degrees Celsius),Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;9;The natural quartz dissolves in the hot alkaline liquid evaporates and deposits itself on the seeds,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;10;As it deposits itself it follows the pattern of the crystalline structure of the seeds,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;11;After about 75 days the chamber can be opened and the newly grown quartz crystals can be removed and cut into the correct proportions,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;12;Different angles and thicknesses in the cutting lead to predictable rates of oscillation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;13;The desired rate of oscillation for quartz used in wristwatches is 100000 megaHertz or 100000 oscillations per second,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;14;In watch assembly the entire set of crystal and microchips is set onto a circuit board,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;15;A battery is also installed that generates electricity for the quartz crystal and supplies the power for the LED display,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;16;To work most effectively the piece of quartz needs to be sealed in a vacuum chamber of one sort or another,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;17;Most commonly the quartz is placed into a sort of capsule with wires attached to both ends so that the capsule can be soldered or otherwise connected to a circuit board,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;18;The electronic leads generated by a battery through the quartz (producing oscillations) will go to a microchip that serves as a frequency dividing circuit,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;19;Microchip manufacture like the quartz is also carried out by the supplier to the watch manufacturer An extensive and complex process making microchips involves chemical andor xray etching of a microscopic electronic circuit onto a tiny piece of silicon dioxide 4 The oscillation rate of perhaps 100000 vibrationssecond is reduced to 1 or 60 or some other more manageable number of oscillations The new pattern of oscillation is then sent to another microchip that functions as a counterdecoderdriver,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;20;This chip will actually count the oscillations that it receives,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;21;If there are sixty oscillations per second the chip will change the reading on an LED every second,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;22;After 3600 oscillations (60 x 60) the counter will instruct the LED to change the reading for minutes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;23;And after 60 x 60 x 60 oscillations (216000) the counter will change the hour reading,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;24;The entire set of crystal and microchips is set onto a circuit board,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;25;The board incorporates a space to hold the battery that supplies electricity to the quartz crystal and supplies the power for the LED display,Relevant
MadeHow;Watch ;26;Generally the space for the battery is on the outside of the surface facing the back of the case,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;27;The battery can be replaced by removing the back of the watch shaking out the old one and dropping in the new battery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;28;The mechanism used for setting the watch is then connected,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;29;This mechanism involves two pins that extend beyond the case of the watch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;30;One pin lets the counter circuit know which reading to reset—seconds minutes or hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;31;The second pin is pushed a number of times to bring the display to the desired reading,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Watch ;32;The entire circuit board along with a battery is then closed into a case and a wrist strap is attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;1;Before consideration can be given to the construction of individual wind turbines manufacturers must determine a proper area for the siting of wind farms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;2;Winds must be consistent and their speed must be regularly over 155 miles per hour (25 kilometers per hour),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;3;If the winds are stronger during certain seasons it is preferred that they be greatest during periods of maximum electricity use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;4;In Californias Altamont Pass for instance site of the worlds largest wind farm wind speed peaks in the summer when demand is high,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;5;In some areas of New England where wind farms are being considered winds are strongest in the winter when the need for heating increases the consumption of electrical power,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;6;Wind farms work best in open areas of slightly rolling land surrounded by mountains,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;7;These areas are preferred because the wind turbines can be placed on ridges and remain unobstructed by trees and buildings and the mountains concentrate the air flow creating a natural wind tunnel of stronger faster winds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;8;Wind farms must also be placed near utility lines to facilitate the transfer of the electricity to the local power plant,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;9;The nacelle is a strong hollow shell that contains the inner workings of the wind turbine such as the main drive shaft and the gearbox,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;10;It also contains the blade pitch control a hydraulic system that controls the angle of the blades and the yaw drive which controls the position of the turbine relative to the wind,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;11;A typical nacelle for a current turbine weighs approximately 22000 pounds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;12;Wherever a wind farm is to be built the roads are cut to make way for transporting parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;13;At each wind turbine location the land is graded and the pad area is leveled,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;14;A concrete foundation is then laid into the ground followed by the installation of the underground cables,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;15;These cables connect the wind turbines to each other in series and also connect all of them to the remote control center where the wind farm is monitored and the electricity is sent to the power company,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;16;Although the towers steel parts are manufactured off site in a factory they are usually assembled on site,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;17;The parts are bolted together before erection and the tower is kept horizontal until placement,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;18;A crane lifts the tower into position all bolts are tightened and stability is tested upon completion,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;19;The fiberglass nacelle like the tower is manufactured off site in a factory,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;20;Unlike the tower however it is also put together in the factory,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;21;Its inner workings—main drive shaft gearbox and blade pitch and yaw controls—are assembled and then mounted onto a base frame,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;22;The nacelle is then bolted The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;23;Cables run from the nacelle to the utility box and from the utility box to the remote control center,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;24;The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;25;Cables run from the nacelle to the utility box and from the utility box to the remote control center around the equipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;26;At the site the nacelle is lifted onto the completed tower and bolted into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;27;Aluminum blades are created by bolting sheets of aluminum together while wooden blades are carved to form an aerodynamic propeller similar in crosssection to an airplane wing,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;28;By far the greatest number of blades however are formed from fiberglass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;29;The manufacture of fiberglass is a painstaking operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;30;First a mold that is in two halves like a clam shell yet shaped like a blade is prepared,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;31;Next a fiberglassresin composite mixture is applied to the inner surfaces of the mold which is then closed,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;32;The fiberglass mixture must then dry for several hours while it does an airfilled bladder within the mold helps the blade keep its shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;33;After the fiberglass is dry the mold is then opened and the bladder is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;34;Final preparation of the blade involves cleaning sanding sealing the two halves and painting,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;35;The blades are usually bolted onto the nacelle after it has been placed onto the tower,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;36;Because assembly is easier to accomplish on the ground occasionally a threepronged blade has two blades bolted onto the nacelle before it is lifted and the third blade is bolted on after the nacelle is in place,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;37;The utility box for each wind turbine and the electrical communication system for the wind farm is installed simultaneously with the placement of the nacelle and blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Wind Turbine;38;Cables run from the nacelle to the utility box and from the utility box to the remote control center,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;1;The process of wine production has remained much the same throughout the ages but new sophisticated machinery and technology have helped streamline and increase the output of wine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;2;Whether such advances have enhanced the quality of wine is however a subject of debate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;3;These advances include a variety of mechanical harvesters grape crushers temperaturecontrolled tanks and centrifuges,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;4;The procedures involved in creating wine are often times dictated by the grape and the amount and type of wine being produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;5;Recipes for certain types of wine require the winemaker (the vintner) to monitor and regulate the amount of yeast the fermentation process and other steps of the process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;6;While the manufacturing process is highly automated in medium to largesized wineries small wineries still use hand operated presses and store wine in musty wine cellars,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;7;A universal factor in the production of fine wine is timing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;8;This includes picking grapes at the right time removing the must at the right time monitoring and regulating fermentation and storing the wine long enough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;9;The winemaking process can be divided into four distinct steps harvesting and crushing grapes fermenting must ageing the wine and packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;10;Vineyardists inspect sample clusters of wine grapes with a refractometer to determine if the grapes are ready to be picked,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;11;The refractometer is a small handheld device (the size of a miniature telescope) that allows the vineyardist to accurately check the amount of sugar in the grapes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;12;If the grapes are ready for picking a mechanical harvester (usually a suction picker) gathers and funnels the grapes into a field hopper or mobile storage container,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;13;Some mechanical harvesters have grape crushers mounted on the machinery allowing vineyard workers to gather grapes and press them at the same time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;14;The result is that vineyards can deliver newly crushed grapes called must to wineries eliminating the need for crushing at the winery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;15;This also prevents oxidization of the juice through tears or splits in the grapes skins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;16;Mechanical harvesters or in some cases robots are now used in most medium to large vineyards thereby eliminating the need for handpicking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;17;First used in California vineyards in 1968 mechanical harvesters have significantly decreased the time it takes to gather grapes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;18;The harvesters have also allowed grapes to be gathered at night when they are cool fresh and ripe,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;19;The field hoppers are transported to the winery where they are unloaded into a crusherstemmer machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;20;Some crusherstemmer machines are hydraulic while others are driven by air pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;21;The grapes are crushed and the stems are removed leaving liquid must that flows either into a stainless steel fermentation tank or a wooden vat (for fine wines),Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;22;Once at the winery the grapes are crushed if necessary and the must is fermented settled clarified and filtered,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;23;After filtering the wine is aged in stainless steel tanks or wooden vats,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;24;White and rose wines may age for a year to four years or far less than a year,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;25;Red wines may age for seven to ten years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;26;Most large wineries age their wine in large temperaturecontrolled stainless steel tanks that are above ground while smaller wineries may still store their wine in wooden barrels in damp wine cellars,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;27;For white wine all the grape skins are separated from the must by filters or centrifuges before the must undergoes fermentation,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;28;For red wine the whole crushed grape including the skin goes into the fermentation tank or vat,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;29;(The pigment in the grape skins give red wine its color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;30;The amount of time the skins are left in the tank or vat determines how dark or light the color will be,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;31;For rose the skins only stay in the tank or vat for a short time before they are filtered out,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;32;During the fermentation process wild yeast are fed into the tank or vat to turn the sugar in the must into alcohol,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;33;To add strength varying degrees of yeast may be added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;34;In addition cane or beet sugar may be added to increase the alcoholic content,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;35;Adding sugar is call chaptalization,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;36;Usually chaptalization is done because the grapes have not received enough sun prior to harvesting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;37;The winemaker will use a handheld hydrometer to measure the sugar content in the tank or vat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;38;The wine must ferments in the tank or vat for approximately seven to fourteen days depending on the type of wine being produced,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;39;After crushing and fermentation wine needs to be stored filtered and properly aged,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;40;In some instances the wine must also be blended with other alcohol,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;41;Many wineries still store wine in damp subterranean wine cellars to keep the wine cool but larger wineries now store wine above ground in epoxylined and stainless steel tanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;42;The tanks are temperaturecontrolled by water that circulates inside the lining of the tank shell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;43;Other similar tanks are used instead of the old redwood and concrete vats when wine is temporarily stored during the settling process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;44;After fermentation certain wines (mainly red wine) will be crushed again and pumped into another fermentation tank where the wine will ferment again for approximately three to seven days,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;45;This is done not only to extend the wines shelf life but also to ensure clarity and color stability,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;46;The wine is then pumped into settling (racking) tanks or vats,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;47;The wine will remain in the tank for one to two months,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;48;Typically racking is done at 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 16 degrees Celsius) for red wine and 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) for white wine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;49;After the initial settling (racking) process certain wines are pumped into another settling tank or vat where the wine remains for another two to three months,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;50;During settling the weighty unwanted debris (remaining stem pieces etc) settle to the bottom of the tank and are eliminated when the wine is pumped into another tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;51;The settling process creates smoother wine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;52;Additional settling may be necessary for certain wines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;53;After the settling process the wine passes through a number of filters or centrifuges where the wine is stored at low temperatures or where clarifying substances trickle through the wine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;54;After various filtering processes the wine is aged in stainless steel tanks or wooden vats,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;55;White and rose wines may age for a year to four years or far less than a year,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;56;Red wines may age for seven to ten years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;57;Most large wineries age their wine in large temperaturecontrolled stainless steel tanks that are above ground while smaller wineries may still store their wine in wooden barrels in damp wine cellars,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;58;The wine is then filtered one last time to remove unwanted sediment,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;59;The wine is now ready to be bottled corked sealed crated labeled and shipped to distributors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;60;Most medium to largesized wineries I now use automated bottling machines and most moderately priced and expensive wine bottles have corks made of a special oak,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wine;61;The corks are covered with a peeloff aluminum foil or plastic seal,Relevant
MadeHow;Wine;62;Cheaper wines have an aluminum screwoff cap or plastic stopper,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Wine;64;Wine is usually shipped in wooden crates though cheaper wines may be packaged in cardboard,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;1;The major steps necessary to process wool from the sheep to the fabric are shearing cleaning and scouring grading and sorting carding spinning weaving and finishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;2;Sheep are sheared once a year—usually in the springtime,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;3;A veteran shearer can shear up to two hundred sheep per day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;4;The fleece recovered from a sheep can weigh between 6 and 18 pounds (27 and 81 kilograms) as much as possible the fleece is kept in one piece,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;7;While most sheep are still sheared by hand new technologies have been developed that use computers and sensitive robotcontrolled arms to do the clipping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;8;Grading is the breaking up of the fleece based on overall quality,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;9;In sorting the wool is broken up into sections of different quality fibers from different parts of the body,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;10;The best quality of wool comes from the shoulders and sides of the sheep and is used for clothing the lesser quality comes from the lower legs and is used to make rugs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;11;In wool grading high quality does not always mean high durability,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;12;Wool taken directly from the sheep is called raw or grease wool,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;13;It contains sand dirt grease and dried sweat (called suint) the weight of contaminants accounts for about 30 to 70 percent of the After being carded the wool fibers are spun into yarn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;14;Spinning for woolen yarns is typically done on a mule spinning machine while worsted yarns can be spun on any number of spinning machines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;15;After the yarn is spun it is wrapped around bobbins cones or commercial drums,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;16;After being carded the wool fibers are spun into yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;17;Spinning for woolen yarns is typically done on a mule spinning machine while worsted yarns can be spun on any number of spinning machines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;18;After the yarn is spun it is wrapped around bobbins cones or commercial drums fleeces total weight,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;20;To remove these contaminants the wool is scoured in a series of alkaline baths containing water soap and soda ash or a similar alkali,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;21;The byproducts from this process (such as lanolin) are saved and used in a variety of household products,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;22;Rollers in the scouring machines squeeze excess water from the fleece but the fleece is not allowed to dry completely,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;23;Following this process the wool is often treated with oil to give it increased manageability,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;24;Next the fibers are passed through a series of metal teeth that straighten and blend them into slivers,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;25;Carding also removes residual dirt and other matter left in the fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;26;Carded wool intended for worsted yarn is put through gilling and combing two procedures that remove short fibers and place the longer fibers parallel to each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;27;From there the sleeker slivers are compacted and thinned through a process called drawing,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;28;Carded wool to be used for woolen yarn is sent directly for spinning,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;29;Thread is formed by spinning the fibers together to form one strand of yarn the strand is spun with two three or four other strands,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;30;Since the fibers cling and stick to one another it is fairly easy to join extend and spin wool into yarn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;31;Spinning for woolen yarns is typically done on a mule spinning machine while worsted yarns can be spun on any number of spinning machines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;32;After the yarn is spun it is wrapped around bobbins cones or commercial drums,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;33;Next the wool yarn is woven into fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;34;Wool manufacturers use two basic weaves the plain weave and the twill,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;35;Woolen yarns are made into fabric using a plain weave (rarely a twill) which produces a fabric of a somewhat looser weave and a soft surface (due to napping) with little or no luster,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;36;The napping often conceals flaws in construction,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;37;Worsted yarns can create fine fabrics with exquisite patterns using a twill weave,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;38;The result is a more tightly woven smooth fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;39;Better constructed worsteds are more durable than woolens and therefore more costly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wool ;40;After weaving both worsteds and woolens undergo a series of finishing procedures including fulling (immersing the fabric in water to make the fibers interlock) crabbing (permanently setting the interlock) decating (shrinkproofing) and occasionally dyeing,Relevant
MadeHow;Wool ;41;Although wool fibers can be dyed before the carding process dyeing can also be done after the wool has been woven into fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;1;Todays zippers comprise key components of either metal or plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;2;Beyond this one very important difference the steps involved in producing the finished product are essentially the same,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;3;A stringer consists of the tape (or cloth) and teeth that make up one side of the zipper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;4;The oldest process for making the stringers for a metal zipper is that process invented by Otto Sundback in 1923,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;5;A round wire is sent through a rolling mill shaping it into a Yshape,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;6;This wire is then sliced to form a tooth whose width is appropriate for the type of zipper desired,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;7;The tooth is then put into a slot on a rotating turntable to be punched into the shape of a scoop by a die,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;8;The turntable is rotated 90 degrees and another tooth is fed into the slot,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;9;After another 90 degrees turn the first tooth is clamped onto the cloth tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;10;The tape must be raised slightly over twice the thickness of the scoop—the cupped tooth—after clamping to allow room for the opposite tooth on the completed zipper,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;11;A slow and tedious process its popularity has waned,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;12;To make the stringer for a spiral plastic zipper a round plastic wire is notched and then fed between two heated screws,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;13;These screws one rotating clockwise the other counterclockwise pull the plastic wire out to form loops,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;14;A head maker at the front of each loop then forms it into a round knob,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;15;This method requires that a left spiral and right spiral be made simultaneously on two separate machines so that the chains will match up on a finished zipper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;16;Another similar method originated in the 1940s,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;17;This entails a flattened strip of wire passing between a heading punch and a pocket punch to form scoops,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;18;A blanking punch cuts around the scoops to form a Y shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;19;The legs of the Y are then clamped around the cloth tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;20;This method proved to be faster and more effective than Sundback s original,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;21;Yet another method developed in the 1930s uses molten metal to form teeth,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;22;A mold shaped like a chain of teeth is clamped around the cloth tape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;23;Molten zinc under pressure is then injected into the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;24;Water cools the mold which then releases the shaped teeth,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;25;Any residue is trimmed,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;26;Plastic zippers can be spiral toothed ladder or woven directly into the fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;27;Two methods are used to make the stringers for a spiral plastic zipper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;28;The first involves notching a round plastic wire before feeding it between two heated screws,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;29;These screws one rotating clockwise the other counterclockwise pull the plastic wire out to form loops,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;30;A head maker at the front of each loop then forms it into a round knob,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;31;Next the plastic spiral is cooled with air,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;32;This method requires that a left spiral and right spiral be made simultaneously on two separate machines so that the chains will match up on a finished zipper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;33;The second method for spiral plastic zippers makes both the left and right spiral simultaneously on one machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;34;A piece of wire is looped twice between notches on a rotating forming wheel,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;35;A pusher and head maker simultaneously press the plastic wires firmly into the notches and form the heads,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;36;This process makes two chains that are already linked together to be sewn onto two cloth tapes,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;37;To make the stringers for a toothed plastic zipper a molding process is used that is similar to the metal process described in step #2 above,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;38;A rotating wheel has on its edge several small molds that are shaped like flattened teeth,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;39;Two cords run through the molds to connect the finished teeth together,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;40;Semimolten plastic is fed into the mold where it is held until it solidifies,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;41;A folding machine bends the teeth into a Ushape that can be sewn onto a cloth tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;42;The stringers for a ladder plastic zipper are made by winding a plastic wire onto alternating spools that protrude from the edge of a rotating forming wheel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;43;Strippers on each side lift the loops off the spools while a heading and notching wheel simultaneously presses the loops into a U shape and forms heads on the teeth which are then sewn onto the cloth tape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;44;Superior garment zippers can be made by weaving the plastic wire directly into the cloth using the same method as is used in cloth weaving,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;45;This method is not common in the United States but such zippers are frequently imported,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;46;Once the individual stringers have been made they are first joined together with a temporary device similar to a slider,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;47;They are then pressed and in the case of metal zippers wire brushes scrub down sharp edges,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;48;The tapes are then starched wrung out and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;49;Metal zippers are then waxed for smooth operation and both types are rolled onto huge spools to be formed later into complete zippers,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;50;The slider and pull tab are assembled separately after being stamped or diecast from metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;51;The continuous zipper tape is then unrolled from its spool and its teeth are removed at intervals leaving spaces that surround smaller chains,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;52;For zippers that only open on one end the bottom stop is first clamped on and then the slider is threaded onto the chain,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;53;Next the top stops are clamped on and the gaps between lengths of teeth are cut at midpoint,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;54;For zippers that separate the midpoint of each gap is coated with reinforcing tape and the top stops are clamped on,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;55;The tape is then sliced to separate the strips of chain again,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;56;The slider and the box are then slipped onto one chain and the pin is slipped onto the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;57;The basic elements of a zipper are the stringer (the tape and teeth assembly that makes up one side of a zipper) the slider (opens and closes the zipper) a tab (pulled to move the slider) and stops (prevent the slider from leaving the chain),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;58;Finished zippers are stacked placed in boxes and trucked to clothing manufacturers luggage manufacturers or any of the other manufacturers that rely on zippers,Relevant
MadeHow;Zipper ;59;Some are also shipped to department stores or fabric shops for direct purchase by the consumer,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;1;The sand and gravel that contain zircon mixed with silicate ilmenite and rutile are typically collected from coastal waters by a floating dredge a large steam shovel fitted on a floating barge,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;2;After the shovel has scooped up the gravel and sand they are purified by means of spiral concentrators which separate on the basis of density,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;3;The ilmenite and rutile are then removed by magnetic and electrostatic separators,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;4;The purest concentrates of zircon are shipped to endproduct manufacturers to be used in metal production while less pure concentrations are used for refractories,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;5;Endproduct manufacturers of zircon further refine the nearly pure zircon into zirconium by using a reducing agent (usually chlorine) to purify the metal and then sintering (heating) it until it becomes sufficiently ductile—workable—for industrial use,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;6;For smallscale laboratory use zirconium metal may be produced by means of a chemical reaction in which chloride is used to reduce the zircon,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;7;The lesspure zircon is made into zirconia an oxide of zirconium by fusing the zircon with coke iron borings and lime until the silica is reduced to silicon that alloys with the iron,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;8;The zirconia is then stabilized by heating it to about 3095 degrees Fahrenheit (1700 degrees Celsius) with additions of lime and magnesia totalling about five percent,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;9;As mentioned above baddeleyite contains relatively high pure concentrations of zirconium oxide that can be used without filtering or cleansing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;10;The only refining process used on baddeleyite involves grinding the gravel or sand to a powder and sizing the powder with different sized sieves,Relevant
MadeHow;Zirconium ;11;All zirconium oxide that comes from baddeleyite is used for refractories and increasingly advanced ceramics,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;1;The mold for producing sheets is assembled from two plates of polished glass separated by a flexible windowframe spacer,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;2;The spacer sits along the outer perimeter of the surface of the glass plates and forms a sealed cavity between the plates,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;3;The fact that the spacer is flexible allows the mold cavity to shrink during the polymerization process to compensate for the volume contraction of the material as the reaction goes from individual molecules to linked polymers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;4;In some production applications polished metal plates are used instead of glass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;5;Several plates may be stacked on top of each other with the upper surface of one plate becoming the bottom surface of the next higher mold cavity,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;6;The plates and spacers are clamped together with spring clamps,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;7;An open comer of each mold cavity is filled with a premeasured liquid syrup of methyl methacrylate monomer and catalyst,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;8;In some cases a methyl methacrylate prepolymer is also added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;9;A prepolymer is a material with partially formed polymer chains used to further help the polymerization process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;10;The liquid syrup flows throughout the mold cavity to fill it,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;11;The mold is then sealed and heat may be applied to help the catalyst start the reaction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;12;As the reaction proceeds it may generate significant heat by itself,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;13;This heat is fanned off in air ovens or by placing the molds in a water bath,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;14;A programmed temperature cycle is followed to ensure proper cure time without additional vaporization of the monomer solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;15;This also prevents bubbles from forming,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;16;Thinner sheets may cure in 10 to 12 hours but thicker sheets may require several days,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;17;When the plastic is cured the molds are cooled and opened,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;18;The glass or metal plates are cleaned and reassembled for the next batch,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;19;The plastic sheets are either used as is or are annealed by heating them to 284302°F (140150°C) for several hours to reduce any residual stresses in the material that might cause warping or other dimensional instabilities,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;20;Any excess material or flash is trimmed off the edges and masking paper or plastic film is applied to the surface of the finished sheets for protection during handling and shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;21;The paper or film is often marked with the materials brand name size and handling instructions,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 1;22;Conformance with applicable safety or building code standards is also noted,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;1;The continuous process is similar to the batch cell process but because the sheets are thinner and smaller the process times are much shorter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;2;The syrup of monomer and catalyst is introduced at one end of a set of horizontal stainless steel belts running parallel one above the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;3;The distance between the belts determines the thickness of the sheet to be formed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;4;The belts hold the reacting monomer and catalyst syrup between them and move it through a series of heating and cooling zones according to a programmed temperature cycle to cure the material,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;5;Electric heaters or hot air may then anneal the material as it comes out of the end of the belts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Plastic 2;6;The sheets are cut to size and masking paper or plastic film is applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;1;The modern method for making aluminum beverage cans is called twopiece drawing and wall ironing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;2;The process begins with an aluminum ingot which was cast to be about 30 inches (76 cm) thick then rolled into a thin sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;3;The first step in the actual manufacture of the can is to cut the sheet into a circle called a blank that will form the bottom and sides of the can,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;4;Each blank is 55 inches (14 cm) in diameter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;5;Some material is necessarily lost between each circle but manufacturers have found that minimum aluminum is lost when the sheets are wide enough to hold two staggered rows of seven blanks each,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;6;About 1214 of the sheet is wasted but can be reused as scrap,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;7;After the circular blank is cut it is drawn or pulled up to form a cup 35 inches (89 cm) in diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;8;The small ripples at the top of the metal are called ears,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;9;Earing is an unavoidable effect of the crystalline structure of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;10;The small cup resulting from the initial draw is then transferred to a second machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;11;A sleeve holds the cup precisely in place and a punch lowered swiftly into the cup redraws it to a diameter of about 26 inches (66 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;12;The height of the cup increases simultaneously from the initial 13 to 225 inches (33 to 57 cm),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;13;The punch then pushes the cup against three rings called ironing rings which stretch and thin the cup walls,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;14;This entire operation—the drawing and ironing—is done in one continuous punch stroke which takes only one fifth of a second to complete,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;15;The cup is now about 5 inches (13 cm) high,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;16;Then another punch presses up against the base of the cup causing the bottom to bulge inward,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;17;This shape counteracts the pressure of the carbonated liquid the can will contain,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;18;The bottom and lower walls of the can are also a little thicker than the upper walls for added strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;19;The drawing and ironing process leaves the can slightly wavy at the top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;20;These small ripples in the metal are called ears,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;21;Earing is an unavoidable effect of the crystalline structure of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;22;Aluminum companies have studied this phenomenon extensively and they have been able to influence the placement and height of the ears by controlling the rolling of the aluminum sheet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;23;Nevertheless some material is lost at this stage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;24;About a quarter inch is trimmed from the top of the can leaving the upper walls straight and level,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;25;The drawing and ironing process leaves the outer wall of the can with a smooth shiny surface so it does not require any further finishing such as polishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;26;After the ears are trimmed the can is cleaned and then imprinted with its label,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;27;After the can is decorated it is squeezed in slightly at the top to a make a neck and the neck is given an outward flange at the very top edge which will be folded over once the lid is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;28;The lid is made of a slightly different alloy than the aluminum for the base and sides of the can,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;29;The inward bulge of the bottom of the can helps it withstand the pressure exerted by the liquid inside it but the flat lid must be stiffer and stronger than the base so it is made of aluminum with more magnesium and less manganese than the rest of the can,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;30;This results in stronger metal and the lid is considerably thicker than the walls,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;31;The lid is cut to a diameter of 21 inches (53 cm) smaller than the 26inch (66 cm) diameter of the walls,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;32;The center of the lid is stretched upward slightly and drawn by a machine to form a rivet,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;33;The pull tab a separate piece of metal is inserted under the rivet and secured by it,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;34;Then the lid is scored so that when the tab is pulled by the consumer the metal will detach easily and leave the proper opening,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;35;To ensure that the cans are made properly they are automatically checked for cracks and pinholes,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;36;One in 50000 cans is usually found to be defective,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;37;After the neck is formed the can is ready to be filled,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;38;The can is held tightly against the seat of a filling machine and a beverage is poured in,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;39;The lid is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;40;The upper flange formed when the can was given its neck is then bent around the lid and seamed shut,Relevant
MadeHow;Aluminum Beverage;41;At this point the can is ready for sale,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;1;The assembly process for the cartridge components begins with a thorough cleaning and polishing of the case by a vibratory finisher,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;2;The finisher works by vibrating a corn byproduct (dried and ground corncobs) with a polishing compound around the cases creating a high luster,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;3;Thus prepared they are ready for final assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;4;This is how a typical centerfire metal cartridge is assembled 1 The cases are fed into a loading press which first sizes the case,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;5;This sizing Ammunitionforms the metal case to standard dimensions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;6;The case must be within 0001 inch for it to function correctly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;8;The primer is then pressed into the case primer hole flush with the base,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;9;The primer must be flush or the cartridge will not feed properly in the weapon magazine causing a jam,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;10;At the same time the mouth of the case is slightly expanded in preparation for receiving the bullet 3 The case is charged or filled with the correct amount of propellant,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;11;This step is of utmost importance for miscalculation or double charging could be disastrous,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;12;The bullet is firmly seated into the open end of the case,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;13;The bullet has a coating of lubricant to prevent corrosion and assist in the assembly process,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;14;The bullet is then crimped into the case to give the correct overall length of the cartridge,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;15;The crimp reduces the diameter of the open end of the case and captures the bullet tightly sealing the assembly together so moisture cannot invade the powder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;16;The press used to assemble cartridges must feed each component accurately and in the correct sequence,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;17;Otherwise cases could be unprimed powder left out or bullets seated incorrectly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;18;Any of these could result in a misfire or loss of accuracy at the minimum and at worst cause the firearm to blow apart upon firing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;19;In each stage of the process special dies perform the important assembly function,Relevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;20;The dies are made of tooling carbide for long life and have close adjustments to produce quality ammunition,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ammunition;21;After assembly the finished cartridges are packaged usually 50 to a box and prepared for shipment to the shooter,Relevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;1;The manufacturing process for antilock brake systems consists of manufacturing the component parts and then installing those parts on the vehicle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;2;The parts are built in one plant then packaged and shipped to a vehicle assembly plant for installation,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;8;The toothed wheel is cast from iron,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;9;Minor machining may be required at the mounting points,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;10;The pickup coils are wound around the permanent magnet core in a machine called a coil winder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;11;The entire assembly is encased or potted in plastic resin with an electrical connector attached,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;12;The electronic controller components are soldered to a printed circuit board,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;13;The board is connected inside a protective housing and mounted to the cast aluminum heat sink base,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;14;Extemal electrical connections are provided for the input wiring from each speed sensor and the output wiring to the solenoids in the master brake cylinder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;15;In the automobile assembly plant the steel tubing brake lines are installed in the framework of the body,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;16;They run from the partition between the engine compartment and the occupant compartment called the firewall to the vicinity of each wheel,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;19;The brake lines are attached to the appropriate ports on the solenoid body and the electrical wires are connected,Relevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;20;The toothed sensor wheels are pressed onto the outer constant velocity joints or the ends of the axle spindles so that they ride just inside the wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;21;Once the axles are attached to the frame the brake lines are attached and the pickup coils are installed so that the end of the coils are close to the toothed wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;22;The pickup coils are then electrically connected to the wires to the controller,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;23;The controller is installed either under the instrument panel or in the vehicles trunk,Relevant
MadeHow;Antilock Brake System;24;The electrical connections are made including the power connection from the vehicle battery through the fusebox,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;1;The refining process starts by piping the crude petroleum from a storage tank into a heat exchanger or tube heater where its temperature is rapidly raised for initial distillation,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;2;It then enters an atmospheric distillation tower where the lighter and more volatile components or fractions vaporize and are drawn off through a series of condensers and coolers,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;3;It is then separated for further refining into gasoline (considered a light distillate) kerosene (considered a medium distillate) diesel oil (considered a heavy distillate) and many other useful petroleum products,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;4;The heavy residue from this atmospheric distillation process is commonly called topped crude,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;5;This topped crude may be used for fuel oil or further processed into other products such as asphalt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;6;Vacuum distillation may remove enough high boiling fractions to yield what is called a straight run asphalt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;7;However if the topped crude contains enough low volatile components which cannot be economically removed through distillation solvent extraction—also known as solvent deasphalting—may be required to produce asphalt cement of the desired consistency,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;8;Asphalt may next be blended or cut back with a volatile substance resulting in a product that is soft and workable at a lower temperature than pure asphalt cement,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;9;When the cutback asphalt is used for paving or construction the volatile element evaporates when exposed to air or heat leaving the hard asphalt cement,Relevant
MadeHow;Asphalt Cement;10;The relative speed of evaporation or volatility of the cutting agent determines whether a cutback asphalt is classified as slow medium or rapidcuring,Relevant

MadeHow;Butter ;1;For many years the major creameries for butter manufacturing were located in the states of the Eastern seaboard but the flourishing of a more industrialized agriculture in the Midwest led to the predominance of buttermaking facilities there,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Butter ;2;The modern buttermaking process begins when fresh cows milk from dairy farms is brought into the facility,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Butter ;3;The product is inspected classified into different groups according to its adjudged quality and then filtered to remove impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;4;Then the milk is separated by means of centrifugal force,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;5;It is pumped into a large cylindrical vertical rotator device,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;6;When turned on this rotator spins the liquid until the cream rises to the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;7;The cream is then fed into large stainless steel vats and heated to 180°F (82°C) for about 30 minutes in the pasteurization process to remove any lingering bacteria,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;8;The pasteurized cream is then left to cool,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;9;The cream is placed in a large mechanical churn usually made of aluminum,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;10;Some of these industrialsized churns can make 15005000 pounds (6812270 kg) of butter at a time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Butter ;11;When the churn is activated it tumbles the cream much like the motion of a clothes dryer while a worker watches the process through a small glass window on the churn,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;12;After about 45 minutes small granules of butter begin to form and the butter and buttermilk are separated,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;13;Salt is added and the mixture is churned further,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;14;When this process is completed a stainless steel mobile device sometimes called a boat is placed adjacent to the opening of the mechanical churn,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;15;The door of the churn is opened and the butter begins to spill out into the boat activating the churn removes the rest,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;16;It is then wrapped into 64pound (29 kg) cartons and sent to the distributor,Relevant
MadeHow;Butter ;17;There the butter is repackaged for consumer and foodservice industry use,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;1;When the ingredients arrive at the margarine manufacturing facility they must first undergo a series of preparatory measures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Margarine;2;The oil—safflower corn or soybean among other types—is treated with a caustic soda solution to remove unnecessary components known as free fatty acids,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;3;The oil is then washed by mixing it with hot water separating it and leaving it to dry under a vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;4;Next the oil is sometimes bleached with a mixture of bleaching earth and charcoal in another vacuum chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;5;The bleaching earth and charcoal absorb any unwanted colorants and are then filtered out from the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;6;Whatever liquid is used in the manufacturing process—milk water or a soybased substance—it too must undergo preparatory measures,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;7;It also undergoes pasteurization to remove impurities and if dry milk powder is used it must be checked for bacteria and other contaminants,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;8;The oil is then hydrogenated to ensure the correct consistency for margarine production a state referred to as plastic or semisolid,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;9;In this process hydrogen gas is added to the oil under pressurized conditions,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;10;The hydrogen particles stay with the oil helping to increase the temperature point at which it will melt and to make the oil less susceptible to contamination through oxidation,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;11;The continuousflow process is the most commonly used method in the manufacture of margarine,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;12;If milk is used as the liquid base it is joined with salt and an emulsifying agent in a chamber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Margarine;13;The emulsifying agent ensures that the emulsification process—chemically defined as a suspension of small globules of one liquid in a second liquid—takes place,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;14;An emulsifier works by decreasing the surface tension between the oil globules and the liquid mixture thereby helping them form chemical bonds more easily,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;15;The result is a substance that is neither wholly liquid nor wholly solid but rather a combination of the two called semisolid,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;16;Lecithin a natural fat derived from egg yolk soybean or corn is one typical emulsification agent used in margarine manufacturing,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;17;In the initial step the liquid salt and lecithin are mixed together into one tank opposite another vat holding the oils and oilsoluble ingredients,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;18;In the continuousflow process the contents of the two vats are fed on a timed basis into a third tank typically called the emulsification chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;19;While the blending process is taking place the equipments sensors and regulating devices keep the mixtures temperature near 100°F (38°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;20;Next the margarine mixture is sent to a device called a Votator the brand name for the most commonly used apparatus in US margarine manufacturing,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;21;It has been standard equipment to the industry since the 1930s,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Margarine;22;In the Votator the margarine emulsion is cooled in what is referred to as Chamber A,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Margarine;23;Chamber A is divided into a trio of tubes that successively decrease its temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;24;Within two minutes the mixture has reached 4550°F (710°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;25;It is then pumped into a second vat called Chamber B,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;26;There it is occasionally agitated but generally left to sit still and form its semisolid state,Relevant
MadeHow;Margarine;27;If it needs to be whipped or otherwise prepared for special consistency the agitation is done in Chamber B,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;1;Polyester arrives at a button factory in liquid form,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;2;At the start of the manufacturing process polyester is drained from its Buttonstorage tank and measured into a stainless steel kettle,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;3;Then dye is added if the buttons are to be any color other than the natural translucence of the polyester,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;4;After the dye is mixed in the liquid polyester is poured into a 3gallon (11 l) metal beaker,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;5;The catalyst and liquid wax are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;6;The mixture of polyester catalyst and wax is then poured into a large rotating metal cylinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;7;The cylinders are made of steel and lined with chrome and are typically 2 feet (61 cm) long and 4 feet (122 cm) in diameter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Button;8;The cylinders lie on their sides on rollers which rotate the drums at 250 rpm,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Button;9;The polyester solution is slowly poured into the rotating interior of the cylinder and the centrifugal force of the rotation causes the solution to spread lining the drum with an even sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;10;A greater amount of polyester is used for thicker buttons and less for thinner ones,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;11;A 2inch (5 cm) lip around the ends of the cylinder prevents the polyester from leaking out,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;12;As the polyester rotates in the cylinder it begins to interact with the chemical catalyst and harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;13;The wax rises to the top of the sheet and also sinks to the bottom so that the hardening polyester is eventually held between two layers of wax,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;14;This process is completed after 20 minutes of rotation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Button;15;The resulting polyester sheet has changed from its liquid state to a crumbly solid likened to the consistency of stale cheese,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;16;When the sheet has reached the proper hardness the drum is stopped and the sheet is cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;17;Then it is rolled out of the cylinder onto a wooden tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;18;The wax makes it easy to remove from the drum but the material is still very delicate,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;19;The top layer of wax is then peeled off and the sheet is transferred to a blanking machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;20;The blanking machine moves the polyester sheet along on a conveyor belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;21;As the sheet passes along the belt circular steel cutting dies descend and punch out buttonsized circles called blanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;22;Buttons come in standard sizes and different diameter dies can be loaded into the blanking machine depending on the size needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Button;23;After the blanks are cut they fall into a chute and the punched out sheet of polyester rolls beneath the chute,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;24;Cutting the blanks from the sheet takes from two to four minutes depending on the size of the buttons being made,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;25;The blanks at this stage are hot because the polyester is still reacting with the catalyst releasing heat,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;26;So at this point the blanks are removed from the chute and poured into a nylon bag,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;27;The bag is then lowered into a tank of salt water which is heated to 230°F (110°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Button;28;The blanks float in the salt water for 15 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;29;The water slowly cools and the polyester blanks harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;30;Next the nylon bag is transferred to a cold water tank and the blanks reach their final state of hardness,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;31;After the hot and cold baths the blanks are dried in a centrifugal drying machine which spins them in a wire mesh basket,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;32;The blanks are now ready to be cut into their finished button shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;33;The exact design of the button can be specified by a clothing manufacturer and the button maker must make a steel cutting tool according to the design he is given,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;34;A different cutting tool is needed for example to make a beveled edge or a flat one or to make a slightly concave button,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;35;When the appropriate cutting tool is in place the buttons are poured into a hopper at the top of the cutting machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;36;The blanks fall into a holder where they are clamped tightly and moved toward the cutting tool,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;37;The spinning blade advances and cuts the button then retracts,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;38;Next the button moves beneath a set of drills which create the holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;39;Like the cutting tool the drills must be designed to conform to the clothing manufacturers specifications,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;40;The design specifies not only two holes or four holes but the diameter of the holes and the distance between them as well,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Button;41;After the buttons pass beneath the drill they are sucked by vacuum out of the holder and into a box beneath the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;42;Hundreds of buttons a minute can be made this way though the number varies according to the size of the button and the complexity of the design,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;43;After the buttons are cut and drilled they have rough or sharp edges scratches and tool marks,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;44;They are placed into hexagonal tumbling drums which contain water an abrasive material and a foaming agent,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;45;The drums spin for up to 24 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;46;The buttons bounce around in the drum until they are smooth and shiny,Relevant
MadeHow;Button;47;After tumbling the buttons are washed and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;1;Optical glass is supplied to lens manufacturers by specialized vendors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;2;Usually it is provided as a pressed plate or sliced glass plate from which the elements are cut,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;3;The glass elements are shaped to concave or convex forms by a curve generator machine that is a firststep grinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;4;To reach the specifications for its shape a lens goes through a sequence of processes in which it is ground by polishing particles in water,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;5;The polishing particles become smaller in each step as the lens is refined,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;6;Curve generation and subsequent grinding vary in speed depending on the frailty softness and oxidation properties of the optical materials,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;7;After grinding and polishing the elements are centered so that the outer edge of the lens is perfect in circumference relative to the centerline or optical axis of the lens,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;8;Lenses made of plastic or bonded glass and resin are produced by the same processes,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;9;Bonded materials are used to make lenses with nonspherical surfaces and these lenses are called hybrid aspherics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;10;The aspherical surfaces of these lenses are completed during centering 2 Formed lenses are coated to protect the material from oxidation to prevent reflections and to meet requirements for designed spectrum transmission or color balance and rendition,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;11;The lens surfaces are carefully cleaned before coating,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;12;Techniques for applying coatings and the coatings themselves are major selling points for a manufacturers lenses and are carefully guarded secrets,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;13;Some types of coatings include metal oxides lightalloy fluorides and layers of quartz that are applied to lenses and mirrors by a vacuum process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;14;Several layers of coating may be applied for the best color and light transmission but excessive coating can reduce the light that passes through the lens and limit its usefulness,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;15;The barrel includes the chassis that supports the various lens elements and the cosmetic exterior,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;16;Metal mounts grooves and moving portions of the lens are critical to the performance of the lens and are machined to very specific tolerances,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;17;Lens mounts may be made of brass aluminum or plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;18;Most metal barrel components are diecast and machined,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;19;Metal mounts last longer maintain their dimensions can be machined more precisely and can be dismantled to replace elements if necessary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;20;Plastic mounts are less expensive and of lighter weight,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;21;If the barrel is made of engineering plastic it is produced by a highly efficient and precise method of injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;22;The interior surfaces of the barrel are also coated to protect them and to prevent internal reflection and flare,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;23;Other parts of the lens such as the diaphragm and auto focus module are produced as subassemblies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;24;The iris diaphragm is constructed of curved leaves cut out of thin sheets of metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;25;The metal leaves are held in place by two plates,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;26;One plate is fixed the other moves and has slots for sliding pins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;27;These slide the leaves back toward the barrel to open the diaphragm or into the center to close the opening as the fstop ring is turned,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;28;The diaphragm assembly is fastened into place when the lens mount is attached to the end of the barrel,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;29;The auto focus is also added the optical elements are positioned and the lens is sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;30;After final assembly the lens is adjusted and inspected rigorously,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;31;It must meet the design standards for optical resolution mechanical function and auto focus response,Relevant
MadeHow;Camera Lens;32;Lenses may also be tested by subjecting them to shocks dropping and vibration,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;1;Since most carpet in the US is tufted earlier methods of weaving carpet such as Wilton and Axminster are ignored in the following account,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;2;Synthetic yarns arrive at the carpet manufacturer either in staple fiber form or bulk Carpetcontinuous filament form,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;3;The staple fibers which average 7 inches (18 cm) long are loose individual strands that arrive in bales,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;4;Several bales are blended together into one batch in a hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;5;Then after lubrication they are spun into long loose ropes called slivers by a carding machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;6;The slivers are then pulled straightened and spun into single yarn that is wound onto spools,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;7;Both the singleply staple fibers (now spun into filament) and the bulk continuous filament must now be twisted together to form thicker twoply yarn suitable for tufting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;8;The yarns are then steamed to bulk them and then heated to 270280°F (132138°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;9;This heat setting causes the yarn to maintain its shape by fixing its twist,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;10;After cooling these yarns are wound onto tubes and transported to the tufting machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;11;Most carpets are dyed after tufting yet sometimes the yarns are dyed first,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;12;The methods include putting 5001000 pounds (227455 kg) of fiber into pressurized vats Carpetthrough which treated dyes are circulated or passing the fiber continuously through the bath or passing skeins of yarn through the vat of dye,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;13;The yarn can also be put on forms and the heated dyes can then be forced under pressure from inside the forms to color the yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;14;Another method passes the yarn through printing rollers while yet another involves knitting the yarn onto a form that is then printed with dyes before the yarn is unraveled,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;15;All yarn that has been dyed is then steamed washed and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;16;The yarn is put on a creel (a bar with skewers) behind the tufting machine then fed into a nylon tube that leads to the tufting needle,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;17;The needle pierces the primary backing and pushes the yarn down into a loop,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;18;Photoelectric sensors control how deeply the needles plunge into the backing so the height of the loops can be controlled,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;19;A looper or flat hook seizes and releases the loop of yarn while the needle pulls back up the backing is shifted forward and the needle once more pierces the backing further on,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;20;To make cut pile a looper facing the opposite direction is fitted with a knife that acts like a pair of scissors snipping the loop,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;21;This process is carried out by several hundred needles (up to 1200 across the 12 foot [37 ml width) and several hundred rows of stitches are carried out per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;22;One tufting machine can thus produce several hundred square yards of carpet a day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;23;For solid color carpeting carpet of several standard roll lengths is sewn together to make a continuous roll which is then fed into a vat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;24;The vat is filled with water which is first heated before dyes and chemicals are mixed in,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;25;The mixture is then slowly brought to a boil and cooked for four hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;26;Another method of making solid color carpet is to sew several rows together to make one continuous roll which is then fed under rods that bleed the color into the pile,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;27;After dyeing the carpet is then steamed to fix the color excess color is washed off and the carpet is dried and put on a roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;28;To make printed carpet of various designs white carpet passes under screens in which holes in the desired pattern have been cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;29;The desired color is squeegeed through the holes in the screen and the carpet is advanced 36 inches (91 cm) to a different screen that applies a new color in a different design through the screen,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;30;Up to eight colors can be applied with this method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;31;Another method of dyeing printed carpet is to pass it under embossed cylinders that have raised portions in a design which press color into the carpet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;32;Each cylinder provides a different design for a different color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Carpet;33;After dyeing the printed carpet is steamed excess dyes are washed off and the carpet is then dried and put onto rolls to go to the finishing department,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;34;The ends of the dyed carpet are first sewn together to form a continuous belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;35;This belt is then rolled under a dispenser that spreads a coating of latex onto the bottom of the carpet,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;36;At the same time a strong secondary backing is also coated with latex,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;37;Both of these are then rolled onto a marriage roller which forms them into a sandwich and seals them together,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;38;The carpet is then placed in an oven to cure the latex,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;39;The completed carpet is then steamed brushed vacuumed and run through a machine that clips off any tufts that rise above its uniform surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Carpet;40;The carpet is then rolled into 120 foot (37 m) lengths that are then packaged in strong plastic and shipped to either the carpet manufacturers inventory warehouse or to a retail carpet store,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;1;Cat litter made from wood paper grain corncobs citrus and grass account for only 5 of todays market,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;2;The rest—about 95 of all cat litter—is clay based,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;3;Cat box fillers contain few ingredients and the entire production process is performed by the manufacturers who mine dry and size their own clay,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;4;Various kinds of clay are found throughout the United States especially in Alabama southern California southern Illinois eastern Kansas Nevada Oregon southeastern Texas and Wyoming,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;5;Clay is found approximately 3040 feet (912 m) below the surface and earth movers scoop it from open pits,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;6;The raw clay is then transported to the plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;7;The clay is loaded onto conveyor belts and spilled into giant crushers,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;8;The crushers break the clay into smaller pieces then deposit them onto another conveyor belt which feeds the clay into a kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;9;The kiln resembles a horizontal chimney or sewer pipe 100 feet (30 m) or more in length,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;10;Inside the kiln where temperatures can reach 2000°F (1093°C) lifters tumble the clay as it bakes,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;11;The clay continues its baking process until it has traveled the entire length of the kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;12;As the clay emerges from the kiln it is fed into a second crusher,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;13;Here rollers crumble the clay to its final consistency,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;14;Next the granules pass through an enclosed machine that contains a series of screens stacked one on top of another,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;15;Here the various sizes of granules are sorted,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;16;Because litter is less absorbent when granules are the same size the sorting process ensures that an assortment of sizes are represented,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;17;Clumping litter which are ground to a smaller size than conventional litter are frequently blended with sodium bentonite a naturally swelling clay known for its absorbent qualities,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;18;A dustcontrolling agent is then added to the ground clay to prevent the dust created when particles rub against one another from becoming airborne,Relevant
MadeHow;Cat Litter;19;Most cat litter manufacturers also add deodorizers to prevent odors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;1;The glass envelope or its components are usually formed at a glass manufacturing facility and shipped to the cathoderay tube manufacturer who forms the phosphor viewing screen fabricates and assembles the electron gun and assembles the finished CRT,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;2;The glass ingredients are weighed and mixed prior to melting,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;3;The glass is melted in gasfired furnaces about 5003000 square feet (46279 sq m) in size,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;4;If this is a continuous process new ingredients are added to maintain a constant level as the molten glass flows out of the furnace to the forming areas,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;5;Before forming the molten glass must be cooled somewhat and made uniform in temperature throughout,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;6;The face plate is normally pressed into the desired shape by dropping a gob of molten glass into a mold and pressing on the gob with a plunger,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;7;The funnel can be formed either by pressing or by centrifugal casting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;8;In the casting method a gob of molten glass drops into a mold which then spins rapidly to spread the glass uniformly over the inside surface of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;9;A grooving disk near the top of the mold cuts the soft glass at the desired height so that the excess glass can be removed easily,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;10;The neck is made from glass tubing and one end is flared to facilitate insertion of the electron gun,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;11;In a monochromatic CRT the three glass components are joined together before they are shipped to the CRT manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;12;In a color CRT only the neck and funnel are joined and the face plate is shipped separately for further processing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;13;The glass components are usually joined by heating the mating surfaces to a high temperature with gas jets or electric heaters,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;14;In monochromatic CRTs the phosphor viewing surface is coated on the inside of the glass face plate,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;15;This is done by preparing a liquid suspension of the phosphor and pouring a measured amount into the neck of the glass envelope along with a gelling agent,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;16;After about 20 minutes the coating has set and the excess liquid is poured off,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;17;The process for color CRTs is more complicated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;18;First the shadow mask is made by applying a lightsensitive coating to the thin mask material exposing it to light through a perforated template and then etching away the exposed coating with an acid to form the millions of holes,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;19;The mask is then pressed into a slightly curved shape and attached just behind the face plate,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;20;The face plate is placed in a centrifuge and the inside surface is coated with the green phosphor material,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;21;The centrifuge spins the face plate to ensure an even coating of phosphor,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;22;A strong ultraviolet light is shown through the mask to harden the green phosphor material into hundreds of thousands of dots,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;23;The remaining material is then washed off,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;24;This process is repeated to form the red and blue phosphor dots with the ultraviolet light being shifted a small amount each time,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;25;When this process is finished the glass face plate is joined to the funnel,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;26;On color tubes the phosphor dots are sensitive to high temperatures so instead of using hightemperature gas jets a mixture of chemical solvent and powdered glass called a frit is applied to the joint,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;27;This acts like a glass solder and the joint can be sealed at a much lower temperature,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;28;The metal components of the electron gun are precision formed,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;29;If coils are used they are wound from fine copper wire,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;30;Some electron guns use metal plates instead of coils and these plates are stamped and formed,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;31;The components are assembled either by hand or with automated machines in a clean environment,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;32;The glass tube is sealed into the base and the base is welded into the gun assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;33;The inside of the glass envelope neck is lubricated with graphite and the electron gun is inserted and aligned,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;34;The neck is then sealed around the gun,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;35;A vacuum pump is attached to the glass tube extending from the rear of the gun and the inside of the CRT is evacuated of air,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;36;When the proper vacuum has been achieved the glass tube is heated and quickly pinched closed to form a seal,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;37;The finished CRT is tested for performance and carefully packed to prevent damage,Relevant
MadeHow;CathodeRay Tube;38;Because the CRT is under a high vacuum any fracture in the glass envelope could result in an inward explosion known as an implosion,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;1;The manufacture of chalkboards begins when large sheets of steel in desired sizes enter the manufacturing facility from an outside supplier,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;2;This steel is coldrolled and inspected for irregularities upon arrival,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;3;Next the large sheets are sent into a chemical washer,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;4;This chamber washes rinses and dries the steel,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;5;When this step is completed the steel is again inspected for flaws and imperfections,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;6;Next a slip is applied to the sheets of steel,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;7;A slip is a mixture of clay or another organic compound applied to a surface during the manufacture of porcelain or other ceramics,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;8;In this case the slip is usually made from silica and applied to both sides of the steel sheet by passing it through a coating chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;9;The coating must be at least 00025 inches (062 mm) thick,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;10;The slip is set aside to dry,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;11;The sheets once again pass through an inspection process before they are transferred to the ground coat furnace area,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;12;This ground coat area of the manufacturing facility typically houses a large furnace chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;13;The sheets of steel are fed into the chamber and subjected to high temperatures,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;14;This softens the steel and allows fusion of the slip with the steel,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;15;This is a crucial step in all porcelain manufacturing and fabrication of industrial ceramics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;16;Once the newly porcelained material leaves the furnace it is treated with a surfacecoating compound,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;17;Typically this compound is derived from glass opacifiers and imparts a smoother texture to the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;18;Oxides for color may also be added,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;19;Again this coating must be at least 00025 inches (062 mm) thick,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;20;The boards are once again sent to a drying area,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;21;After they are completely cooled and dried they are once again inspected for surface blemishes and uniformity of color,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;22;Next the boards are placed in a cover coat furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;23;The purpose of this heating process is to fuse the first ground coat with the surface coat,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;24;A temperature of at least 1200°F (649°C) is needed to successfully complete this process,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;25;Next the chalkboards are passed through a cooling chamber which gradually reduces the temperature of the steel so that the flat sheets do not buckle or weaken which might occur if left to cool by themselves,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;26;Next the surface of the chalkboard is laminated onto a fiberboard,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;27;This backing material must be at least 044 (11 mm) inch thick,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;28;A special adhesive is used for this application,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;29;In the next few steps the finishing touches are put on the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Chalkboard;30;A wood or aluminum trim is added to the edges to make a border and accessories such as chalktrays map rails and hooks and flag holders are attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;1;Tobacco is initially grown in outdoor frames called seedbeds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;2;In warm regions the frames are covered with mulch or a cotton top sheet in cooler regions glass or plastic shields are installed to protect the plants,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;3;After 810 weeks when the seedlings are almost 10 inches (25 cm) tall they are transplanted to the fields,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;4;Although transplanting machines are available the vast majority of the worlds tobacco plants are still planted manually,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;5;As the plants grow the heads are broken off by hand so the leaves will grow fuller a process called topping,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;6;The plants stay in the field 90120 days before they are harvested,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;7;Tobacco plants are harvested by one of two methods priming or stalkcutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;8;In the priming method the leaves are gathered and brought to a curing bam as they ripen,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;9;In the stalkcutting method the entire plant is cut and the plants are allowed to Cigarettewilt in the field before being taken to the curing barn,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;10;Next the leaves are carefully gradually dried in a specially constructed barn by air curing flue curing or fire curing,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;11;Air curing uses natural weather conditions to dry tobacco,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;12;Stalks are hung in a barn with ventilators that can be opened and closed to control temperature and humidity,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;13;Artificial heat is used only during cold or excessively humid weather,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;14;The stalks are hung for four to eight weeks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;15;Flue curing is done in small tightly constructed barns that are artificially heated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;16;The heat comes from flues (metal pipes) that are attached to furnaces,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;17;Open oil and gas burners are sometimes used but this method is problematic because smoke cannot come in direct contact with the tobacco,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;18;Flue curing takes about four to six days,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;19;Fire curing dries tobacco with lowburning wood fires whose smoke comes in direct contact with the leaves thus producing a smoky flavor and aroma,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;20;The tobacco is allowed to dry naturally in the barn for three to five days before it is firedried for 340 days,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;21;Unless humid weather conditions eliminate the need the brittle cured tobacco leaves must be conditioned in moistening chambers so they do not break when they are handled,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;22;After moistening the tobacco is stripped,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;23;During this process the leaves are sprayed with additional moisture as a precaution against cracking or breaking,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;24;After the leaves are moistened and stripped they are sorted into grades based on size color and quality and tied in bundles for shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;25;The farmers then bring the tobacco to warehouses where it is placed in baskets weighed graded once again by a government inspector and finally auctioned to cigarette manufacturers,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;26;After they have purchased and transported the material to their factories manufacturers treat and age the tobacco to enhance its flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;27;First the manufacturer Cigaretteredries the tobacco,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;28;This involves completely drying the leaves by air and then adding a uniform amount of moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;29;Packed into barrels called hogsheads the tobacco is then aged for one to three years during which period it develops its flavor and aroma,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;30;After it is aged the tobacco leaves are again moistened and the stalks and other wastes removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;31;Leaves from different types of tobacco are mixed to create a particular flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;32;After blending the tobacco leaves are pressed into cakes and mechanically shredded,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;33;Materials such as fruit juices or menthol are added to give additional flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;34;The final shredded tobacco is then dispersed over a continuous roll of cigarette paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;35;A machine rolls the shredded tobacco into the paper and cuts it to the desired length,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;36;A device then grabs each cigarette and fastens a filter in one end,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;37;Modern cigarette machines can produce 2530 cigarettes a second,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;38;The final stage of cigarette manufacture is packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;39;The completed cigarettes are packed 20 to a package,Relevant
MadeHow;Cigarette;40;The hard or soft packs are mechanically sealed in cellophane and handplaced in cartons,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;1;The actual manufacturing process proceeds as follows,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;2;The base of the machine is either cast or welded together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;3;It is then heat treated to remove casting or welding stresses and to normalize the metal for machining,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;4;The base is fixtured into a large machining center and the mounting areas for the ways are machined to specification,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;5;The ways are ground flat bolted and pinned to the base,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;6;The mechanisms that move the bed or spindle are called ballscrews,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;7;These change rotary motion of the drive motors into linear motion and consist of a screw shaft and support bearings,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;8;As the shaft turns a bearing mount follows the spiral grooves in the shaft and produces a very accurate linear movement that moves either the worktable under the spindle or the spindle carrier itself,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;9;These ballscrews are bolted to the base with the bearing mount bolted to the worktable or spindle carrier,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;10;The spindle is machined and ground mounted to its drive motor and then bolted to the movable spindle carrier,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;11;Each axis of motion has a separate ballscrew and set of ways in most machining centers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;12;The computer or controller is an electronic assembly separate from the rest of the machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;13;It has a climatecontrolled enclosure mounted on the side of the frame or in an operators console,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;14;It contains all of the operating memory computer boards power supplies and other electronic circuitry to operate the machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;15;Assorted wiring connects the controller to the machine motors and positional slides,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;16;The CNC Machine Toolslides continuously send the axis location information to the controller so the exact position of the worktable in relationship to the spindle is always known,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;17;The front of the controller has a video screen that displays the program information position speeds and feeds and other data required for the operator to monitor the machines performance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;18;Also on the front panel are the data entry keys data connection ports and startstop switches,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;19;The assembled machine is test run for accuracy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;20;Each machine has slight physical differences that are mathematically corrected in the computer operating system,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;21;These correction values are stored in a separate memory and the machine checks these continuously,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;22;As the machining center wears from use these parameters can be recalibrated to assure accuracy,Relevant
MadeHow;CNC Machine Tool;23;After testing the finished machine is painted and prepared for shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;1;When a new coin has been commissioned sculptors employed by the mint develop a set of sketches,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;2;When one particular sketch has been approved and refined the sculptor creates a clay model,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;3;The model can be anywhere from three to twelve times larger than the actual coin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;4;Plaster is poured over the clay model to create a negative or reverse plaster model,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;5;The words of the inscriptions are carved into the plaster in reverse,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;6;The sculptor repeats this process several times until the plaster model is perfect,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;7;Next a durable rubber mold is made by pouring epoxy into the plaster mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;8;The epoxy mold is mounted onto a transferengraver,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;9;At one end of the transferengraver a stylus traces the epoxy mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;10;As the stylus moves a ratio bar in the middle of the engraver reduces the design to the actual coin size,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;11;This reduced size is communicated to a carbide tool at the opposite end which then cuts the design into a steel blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;12;The result is a positive replica called a master hub,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;13;The sculptors examine the master hub and remove any imperfections 4 Heattreated metal is placed under a computerized lathe where it is smoothed Coinand polished into a precisely measured blank die The master hub is pressed into the die The result is called the master die,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;14;The master die is used to create working hubs and working dies The master hubs and dies are then placed in storage 5 The appropriate coil of metal is fed through a blanking press which punches out round disks corresponding in size to the coin to be minted The blanks are cut at a speed of 400 strokes per minute The leftover scraps of metal are shredded and recycled for future use 6 The blanks are subjected to another annealing process and then placed in industrial washing machines and dryers The lubricants used in these various processes cause the blanks to become stained and oxidized 7 The blanks are next placed into revolving tubs or barrels filled with an acidic pickling agent As the blanks are tossed together in the tubs they become burnished Sorting and weeding the blanks 8 The blanks are sifted through a riddler a metal sheet fitted with holes that match the exact size of the particular coin to be minted,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;15;In this manner misshapen and oddsized blanks are weeded out,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;16;The perfect blanks are carried by conveyer belt to the coining press where they are stamped with designs and inscriptions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;17;A steel collar is inserted into the press around one of the dies,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;18;The die for the reverse side is loaded into the upper arm of the press,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;19;Hundreds of tons of air pressure push the blank into the collar,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;20;At the same time the overhead die is forced down into the collar and onto the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;21;The impact causes the impressions to form on both sides of the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;22;The press releases the newly minted coin and it moves along a conveyer belt to the inspection line,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;23;In some instances the collar has grooves to make the ridged edges on the coin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;24;Otherwise the grooves are made after the striking process on a tool called an upsetting mill,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;25;The size of the press varies from single capacity to ones that stamp four coins simultaneously,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;26;Singlestriking presses generally stamp 400 coins per minute with pressure loads up to 180 tons,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;27;Multiple presses can crank out 120 coins per minute under 250 tons of pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Coin;28;The press operator spotchecks each batch of new coins with a magnifying glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;29;The coins move through another riddler that sorts out blanks that have become misshapen or dented during the striking process,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;30;An automatic counting machine spits I out a predetermined amount of coins and drops them into large canvas bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Coin;31;The bags are sewn shut loaded onto pallets and then moved by forklift trucks to storage vaults,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;1;Rubber latex is obtained from the milky fluid produced by various tropical plants,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Condom;2;Latex is actually an emulsion or dispersion of tiny rubber particles in water and ingredients added to the latex must be able to attach to the rubber particles during compounding,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;3;Next chemical additives are mixed to form a paste,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;4;This paste is then blended with the liquid latex in a process called compounding,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;5;The latex and chemical compound is then unloaded into drums for storage where it remains for approximately seven days,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;6;During this period vulcanization chemically strengthens the bonds of the rubber,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;7;The storage time also allows any Condomair which might have been trapped in the mixture during compounding to escape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Condom;8;The compound is then added to the dipping or condomforming machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;9;The dipping machine is a long hooded machine approximately 100 feet (305 m) in length,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Condom;10;Thick tempered glass rods move along a closed belt between two circular gears,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;11;The belt drags the rods which are called mandrels through a series of dips into the latex compound,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;12;The mandrels rotate to spread the latex evenly,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;13;Several coats are required to build the condom to its required thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;14;Between each dip the latex is hot air dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;15;After the final dipping and drying the condoms automatically roll off the mandrels,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;16;A machine shapes and trims the ring of latex at the base of each condom,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;17;Next the condoms are put in a tumbling machine where they are coated with talc or another similar powder to prevent the rubber from sticking to itself,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;18;After a curing period of several days the condoms are sampled by batch and tested for leaks and strength,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;19;The first such test is the inflation test in which the condom is filled with air until it bursts,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;20;Condoms are required to stretch beyond 15 cubic feet about the size of a watermelon before bursting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Condom;21;In the waterleakage test the condom is filled with 10 ounces (300 ml) of water and inspected for pinsized holes by rolling it along blotter paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;22;Condoms are also tested electronically,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;23;This involves mounting each condom on a charged stainless steel mandrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Condom;24;The mandrel is passed over by a soft conductive brush,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;25;If pin holes are present a circuit will be established with the mandrel and the machine will automatically reject the condom,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;26;Condoms that have successfully passed these tests are rolled by a machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;27;Rolling the condom makes it easier to package and use,Relevant
MadeHow;Condom;28;Lubricant and spermicide may be applied by a metering pump just before the top wrap is added in the foiling process,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;1;Molding the lens can be carried out in several different ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;2;The lenses first developed in Prague were spincast,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;3;Three different fluids were poured into open rotating molds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;4;The outside curvature of the lens was shaped by the mold and the inside curvature was formed according to the speed of the rotation of the mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;5;The centrifugal force of the spinning mold led to the polymerization of the fluids so that the molecular chains linked to form the required hydrophilic plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;6;A more reliable massproduction Contact Lensmethod is injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;7;In injection molding the molten plastic is injected into the mold under pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;8;Then the lens is removed from the mold and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;9;The lens is then finished on a lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;10;It is also possible to produce lenses entirely through molding that is they need no lathe cutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;11;This is a recent development made possible through highly automated computer controlled mold production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;12;The initial forming of the lens can also be done by cutting on a lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;13;First a blank is made,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;14;The blank is a circle only slightly larger than the size of the finished lens,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;15;This can be cut from a plastic rod or stamped from a plastic sheet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;16;Next the blank is fastened to a steel button with a drop of molten wax,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;17;The button is then centered on a lathe which begins to spin at high speed,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;18;A cutting tool which may be a diamond or a laser makes concave cuts in the blank to form the CPC,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;19;Indicators on the lathe measure the depth of the cuts to guide the lens operator,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;20;The button holding the blank is next moved to a lapping machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;21;The lapping machine holds the blank against a lapper which is a revolving disk coated with an abrasive compound,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;22;The shape of the lapper matches the CPC of the lens,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;23;The lapping machine spins the blank in one direction and the lapper in the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;24;It also moves the blank in a small figure eight motion,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;25;The abrasion polishes the lens surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;26;The polished lens is then mounted on a steel shaft called an arbor,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;27;The end of the arbor has been ground to match the CPC so the lens will fit on the shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;28;The arbor is installed in a lathe and the operator makes convex cuts in the lens to form the other major curve the CAC,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;29;Now this side of the lens is polished and the lapper is modified to fit the convex CAC,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;30;When this second side of the lens is polished the lens is considered semifinished,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;31;The contact lens requires several more curves to be ground before the lens will fit exactly on the patients eye,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;32;The final curves are the peripheral anterior and posterior curves and the intermediate anterior and posterior curves which govern the shape of the lens nearest and nextnearest the edge,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;33;The lens is mounted on an arbor again by suction or with doublesided tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;34;The arbor is installed in the lathe or grinding machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;35;These shallower cuts may be ground with emery paper or cut with a razor blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;36;The diameter of the lens may also be trimmed at this time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;37;Quality control is very important for contact lenses since they are medical devices and they must be custom fit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;38;The lenses are inspected after each stage of the manufacturing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;39;The lenses are examined under magnification for anomalies,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;40;They are also measured by means of a shadow graph,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;41;A magnified shadow of the lens is cast on a screen imprinted with a graph for measuring diameter and curvature,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;42;Any errors in the lens shape show up in the shadow,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;43;This process may be automatically performed by computer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;44;After the lens has passed inspection it is sterilized,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;45;Lens are boiled in a mixture of water and salt for several hours to soften the lens,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;46;Next the lens are packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;47;Standard packaging for lenses is a glass vial filled with a saline solution and stoppered with rubber or metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;48;The hydrophilic material of soft contact lenses soaks up the saline solution which is similar to human tears and becomes soft and pliable,Relevant
MadeHow;Contact Lens;49;The lenses in this state are ready to wear,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;1;Once the leather has been selected the process of making the top part of the boot begins by cutting out the individual pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;2;This might be done by hand in custom shops but in factories it is done by metal dies which work like cookie cutters,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;3;The top of a boot consists of three parts the part that covers the top of the foot the part that encloses the back of the heel and the part that fits around the bottom of the shins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;4;These are called respectively the vamp the counter and the uppers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;5;The vamp is like the top and sides of an ordinary mans shoe but it is one piece instead of several without lace holes and a separate tongue,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;6;The counter covers what the vamp does not,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;7;The uppers are cut in two pieces one for the front and one for the back designed to join each other at the sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;8;At this stage the lining for the inside of each of these pieces is cut out and then glued into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;9;The lining is particularly important for boots made of fragile skins such as snake or eel for the leather backing will provide most of the strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;10;If the boot is to have any kind of stitched decoration—whether a simple Cowboy Bootspattern or an elaborate picture such as a yellow rose an oil derrick or the state of Texas—this is done before the pieces are assembled,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;11;In custom shops the design is sketched on a paper pattern or stencil and then outlined with a series of small holes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;12;This stencil is laid over each piece and then sprinkled with a marking agent such as white powder so the design can be followed by someone operating a sewing machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;13;Factories tend to use computerized sewing machines for this task with preprogrammed designs so marking the leather isnt necessary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;14;Any additional colors the design requires are dyed into the leather at this stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;15;The boot is initially assembled in two halves front and back,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;16;The vamp the part that covers the top and sides of the foot is sewn to the front upper the counter the part that covers the heel is sewn to the back upper,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;17;Excess leather around the stitching is then trimmed off,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;18;A long strip of leather called the welt is then attached to the back of the counter and left hanging there,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;19;The welt will be used at a later stage to attach the top of the boot to the sole,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;20;The front and back halves of the boot are then glued and sewn together,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;21;These seams are made first on the inside so the boot initially takes shape inside out like a shirt,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;22;Leather is however harder to work than cotton and once the seams are made the top of the boot must be soaked in water until the leather is flexible enough to be turned right outside out again,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;23;At the end of this stage the top part of the boot is complete in a custom shop the work of a top man would now be done,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;24;The first step in building the bottom of the boot is attaching the insole to the vamp and the counter,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;25;The insole in any shoe or boot is the part you see when looking down inside it it often bears the imprint of the makers name,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;26;A key component in this part of the process is the last,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;27;The last is basically a model of a foot—an anatomically accurate version of a shoetree—which is left inside the boot during the rest of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;28;In a factory lasts are standard sizes and generally made of molded plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;29;In custom shops they are made of hardwood and adjusted to the precise shape of an individuals foot,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;30;The workshop of these bootmakers may contain Cowboy Bootsthousands of lasts hanging from the walls and ceilings available for the customers they expect to reorder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;31;The insole is first tacked to the last,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;32;Then the vamp and the counter are nailed over the insole into the last—first in front at the toe and then working around on both sides towards the back,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;33;At this point a stiff piece of leather is inserted at the front of the vamp to reinforce the boot at the toe,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;34;The welt which has been hanging on the back of the counter since the top was first made is then sewn onto the vamp and the insole,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;35;The boot is now almost complete lacking only a heel and a sole,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;36;Because the welt now binds together the insole the vamp and the counter the nails that tacked the leather to the last are no longer necessary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;37;The nails are removed but the last remains inside the boot until it is finished,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;38;A metal shank is then attached to the insole to reinforce the high arch it is held in place by a piece of leather,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;39;The sole is shaped to fit the insole and then stitched to the welt,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;40;The heel is then nailed on and then both the heel and the sole are shaped by sanding,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;41;The finishing process gives the boot its final appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;42;The last is removed and a boot tree is used to make fine adjustments in the shape of the boot,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;43;Seams are trimmed and stray threads cut short,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;44;Final dyes are applied if necessary and then the boot is waxed and polished,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;45;The boots are checked for quality at this stage though the standards of quality control vary between factories and custom shops,Relevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;46;In a custom shop how the boot fits an individual customer will distinguish an approved product from one that may need to be reworked or rejected,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cowboy Boots;47;But with both kinds of manufacturing the number of stitches per inch is important as is the quality of the leather and the strength of the welt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Crayon;1;In the American market the predominant manufacturer is the Binney Smith Company of Pennsylvania which manufactures more than two billion crayons a year,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Crayon;2;The paraffin is pumped into supply tanks outside the crayon factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Crayon;3;Each tank holds about 17000 gallons (65875 1) of liquid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Crayon;4;When the process begins the paraffin is piped into small heated tubs with a volume of about 6 gallons (23 1) (about the size of a home washing machine),Irrelevant

MadeHow;Dental Floss;6;Correctly twisting the nylon is a vital part of this process the turns average between 25 and 35 per inch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;7;Twisting adds strength to the floss as well as greatly reducing fraying or breaking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;8;Since floss consists of many filaments it can be produced in different decitexes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;9;Dental floss is commonly made out of one of two synthetic compounds nylon or Teflon Decitex is defined as the weight of 10000 meters of unwaxed nylon in grams Floss is also measured by Denier,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;10;Denier is defined as the weight of 9000 meters of uncoated floss in grams There is a direct correlation between the numerical value of the decitex or denier and the thickness of the strand of floss if this value increases the thickness of the strand also increases 2 To produce a Teflon dental floss a polymer of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is formulated Next the polymer is melted into a paste and stretched into a long thin strand The polymer is then expanded into one or more directions The PTFE is cut forming different deniers After the PTFE is processed its tensile strength is substantial Unlike multifilament nylon flosses PTFE is a monofilament which does not shred or break easily Therefore twisting is not required for this process The rates of stretching during the manufacturing process give this floss its added strength 3 This process allows manufacturers to differentiate their products by permeating the floss with distinctive and proprietary coatings The coating takes place in emulsion baths where the floss is pulled through waxes flavors and other desired coatings at a consistent velocity 4 Floss bobbins are next wound in one of two shapes cylindrical or roll type Winding the floss bobbins requires the use of equipment that transfers the yarn from one type of spool to another type A cylindrical bobbin is dispensed through a tube or rectangularshaped package It can be wound where the floss is pulled through the center or pulled from the outer layer first The advantage to this type of bobbin is that it can accommodate more yardage The roll bobbin is the more conventional type of floss bobbin It is dispensed through flat containers by pulling from the outer layer only 5 The standard case for nylon flosses is an angled twopiece construction usually polypropylene with an insert that holds the floss spool Recently many manufacturers have opted to upgrade their floss dispensers by using a onepiece clam shell construction that incorporates a window to gauge product use as well as grooves to facilitate gripping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;11;Floss bobbins are usually assembled manually into the floss container,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Dental Floss;15;There are three basic methods of decoration pad printing labeling and thermal transfer,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;16;Pad printing is the most prevalent form of decorating used in the US,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;17;Labeling is the preferred choice for most product exported to Europe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;18;Thermal transfer generates an image quality equal to or better than the pad printing image with the advantage that it allows for a greater range of colors and designs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Floss;19;Marketers prefer blister packaging (a plastic mold affixed to a cardboard backing which can hang on a display peg) because it prominently displays the package and eliminates the need for paper packaging which is deemed better for the environment,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Diamond;1;Block caving is the most commonly used method in excavating diamonds from kimberlite deposits,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;2;This method offers the highest yield and thus is the most cost effective,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;3;First a large vertical hole is excavated typically 1750 feet (533 m) in diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;4;Levels are placed approximately every 40 feet (12 m),Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;5;Along these levels are horizontal tunnels known as scraper drifts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;6;In the drifts there are small inclined coneshaped openings at intervals of every 11 feet (3 m) or so,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;7;These openings are roughly four feet by four feet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;8;When a horizontal slice is cut above the cones—usually about six feet (18 m) in height—the kimberlite begins to break off and fall into the cone and into the scraper drift,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;9;The material is then pushed onto trucks,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;10;The trucks travel underground through the mining area and take the collected kimberlite to a crushing device,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;11;In the crushing operation which occurs in the belowground mining facilities large chunks of kimberlite are broken up into more easily transportable segments,Relevant

MadeHow;Diamond;15;When no more kimberlite is found entering the cones the area is depleted and work moves on to a lower level,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;16;The actual diamonds must be separated from the rock that surrounds them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;17;Crushing or milling the excavated material is the first step but this is done in a rudimentary form so as not to damage the potential gems inside,Relevant

MadeHow;Diamond;34;This device is usually slanted and vibrated,Relevant
MadeHow;Diamond;35;The method operates on the premise that diamonds newly excavated will not become wet when brought into contact with water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;36;Instead they will stick to the grease,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;37;Petroleum jelly is usually the preferred substance on the grease belt or table,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;38;The water then carries away the remaining nondiamond particles,Relevant

MadeHow;Diamond;40;In a newer method Xray technology is used to determine which of the concentrate is diamond and which is effluvial material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;41;Chunks of diamond eventually become small perfectly shaped gemstones commonly used in engagement rings and other jewelry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Diamond;42;Since diamond is the hardest known substance diamond dust must be used to cut the stone,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Dynamite;1;The explosive oil is carefully added to a mechanical mixer where it is absorbed by the dope which can be either diatomaceous earth (now no longer used) wood pulp sawdust flour starch andor other carbonaceous substances and combinations of substances,Relevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;2;Approximately 1 antacid such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide is added to neutralize any acidity present in the dope,Relevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;3;The mixture is monitored carefully and when the correct ingredient level is attained the mixture is ready for packaging into the various forms,Relevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;4;This process produces what is termed straight dynamite in which the dope does not contribute to the explosive strength of the dynamite,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;5;For example 40 straight dynamite contains 40 nitroglycerin and 60 dope 35 straight dynamite contains 35 nitroglycerin and 65 dope,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;6;In some cases sodium nitrate is mixed with the dope which acts as an oxidizer and gives additional strength to the explosive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;7;The appearance of dynamite typically resembles a round cartridge approximately 125 inches (32 cm) in diameter and 8 inches (20 cm) long,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dynamite;8;This type is produced by pressing the dynamite mixture into a paper tube sealed with paraffin,Relevant

MadeHow;Fiberglass;50;The mold forms in lengths of 3 feet (91 cm) or less are then cured in an oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberglass;51;The cured lengths are then demolded lengthwise and sawn into specified dimensions,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberglass;52;Facings are applied if required and the product is packaged for shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;1;The selection and purchase of the truck chassis is based upon the tactical application of the apparatus,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;2;The truck frame may be bare having only the engine axles springs frame members steering and brake systems installed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;3;The apparatus builder may choose however to use a cab and chassis where the frame has the engine cab seats front sheet metal and wiring already completed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;4;In either case the truck frame is usually ordered from a wellestablished truck builder such as General Motors Ford International Freightliner or Peterbilt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;5;The apparatus builder advises the truck manufacturer of the intended design so special options concerning the performance of the frame can be made,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;6;It is critical that the proper selection of suspension be made to support the average 35000pound (15890 kg) fire engine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;7;In our example we have chosen the cab and chassis frame design,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;8;The basic design of the fire apporatus begins with a thorough review of the fire lood and geographicol terroin of the area the fire department will be responding to,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;9;After the truck frame is received and inspected the fabrication of the body (or coach as it is sometimes called) begins,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;10;Primarily sheet steel is used for body panels and supports although aluminum and some stainless steel are also incorporated,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;11;Sheet steel is approximately 0,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;12;06 inch (1,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;13;5 mm) thick and comes in sheets 48 inches (1,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;14;2 m) and 96 inches (2,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;15;4 m) long,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;16;It can also be supplied in rolls of the same width and weighing 2000 pounds (908 kg) or more,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;17;Each door panel support body panel and equipment tray is cut and bent using shearing machines and press brakes,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;18;Holes for electrical equipment and piping are also punched at this time,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;19;The body is typically metal inert gas (Mig) welded together with the doors and access panels bolted for ease of replacement,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;20;Many manufacturers protect the body from corrosion by dipping each panel into a rust inhibiting sealer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;21;The interior and other hidden areas of the doors and cabinets are prepainted before assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;22;While the body construction is underway the pump and tank are mounted to the frame,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;23;The pump is selected to perform specifically for the practices of the fire department,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;24;Essentially the pump is the only reason for the fire engine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;25;All of the other features are practically useless if the pump does not perform adequately,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;26;Most firepumps today are centrifugal pumps and are manufactured by separate companies and purchased by the apparatus builder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;27;A typical firepump can pump 1000 gallons (3785 1) of water per minute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;28;This flow can safely provide enough water to fight a residential or small commercial building fire,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;29;Pump size can be restricted by the available water supply particularly in rural areas where there are no fire hydrants,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;30;Pumps are usually cast iron with bronze for the rotating impeller and steel gears in the drive unit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;31;Our truck shall have the 1000 gallon per minute pump bolted to the frame near the center and driven by an auxiliary output shaft (or power take off) from the truck transmission,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;32;This type of arrangement is referred to as a midship pump apparatus,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;33;The pump sits across the frame of the truck and is bolted through the support castings to the upper frame flange,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;34;Alignment with the transmission is important to reduce vibration,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;35;The water tank for this example apparatus would typically be a polypropylene tank holding 5001000 gallons (18923785 1) of water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;36;This is bolted to special Fire Enginesupports before being attached to the frame immediately behind the pump,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;37;Connective piping to the pump and filling openings is also installed typically of galvanized steel construction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;38;Tanks may be square round or oval and many are hotwelded together out of sheet material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;39;The hotwelding process uses a high temperature stream of air to melt the plastic pieces at their joint where the material mixes and fuses together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;40;Most tanks contain perforated plates or baffles to reduce the sloshing of the water while driving,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;41;Occasionally a quick dump is installed in the tank of an apparatus designed for use in rural locations,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;42;This large valve dumps the water from the main tank into a folding portable tank carried to the fire on a separate tanker truck,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;43;This allows the tanker trucks to shuttle water from long distances and empty into the portable tank where large suction hoses feeding directly into the pump allow the flow to be increased to maximum capacity,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;44;These quick dump valves empty the 1500 gallons (5677 1) of water in 45 seconds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;45;When the body is completed it is mounted to the frame over the pump and tank and bolted using neoprene or rubber vibration strips,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;46;Along each side and above the tank are the equipment and hose compartments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;47;They are formed into the body with doors and covers for protection,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;48;Related equipment such as hose nozzles as well as tactical equipment such as forcible entry tools and selfcontained breathing units are stored in the side equipment compartments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;49;They are sized and equipped to allow the fastest and easiest deployment of the equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;50;The hose beds carry the fire hose,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;51;The top bed usually contains 50 foot (15 m) long 2,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;52;5 inch (76 cm) diameter sections of fire hose connected together to form hoselines reaching up to 1000 feet (305 m),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;53;This hose is folded in such a manner as to allow it to be pulled from its bed with ease and speed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;54;Shorter sections of suction hoses are also carried on the apparatus,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;55;These suction hoses are made of a firm material so they do not collapse from the reduced pressure when coupled to the suction of the pump,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;56;They cannot be folded so they are usually placed into hose troughs specially designed for suction hoses,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;57;All other types of fire hoses are collapsible and for use on the pressure side of the pump only,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;58;After the last accessories and wirings are installed and individually tested the apparatus builder submits the finished truck to an independent inspection agency,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;59;Upon successful testing the apparatus and the builder are awarded a certificate of performance,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;60;In front of the tank and above the pump are the attack hoseline beds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;61;These beds contain 1,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;62;5 inch (3,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;63;8 cm) diameter firehoses preconnected to the output of the pump with the nozzles ready for action,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;64;Two or four beds of preconnects are common,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;65;These will be the first hoses used in the incident therefore they are the most important,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;66;Behind the tank is the reel booster,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;67;Here a oneinch (2,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;68;5 cm) diameter hose on a power rollup reel is stored,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;69;This booster hose is used for cleaning the apparatus and equipment and for cooling the outside of the apparatus when it is near a large fire,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;70;It is also occasionally used to put out small trash or grass fires,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;71;This reel is handy because the hose can be quickly rewound by simply pressing a button,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;72;All other hoses on the fire truck must be washed and packed back into their beds by hand after the fire incident,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;73;Ladders for the fire service are extra heavy duty,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;74;Though made out of aluminum they are physically heavy so they are typically carried in racks above the curbside (right side) equipment compartments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;75;Power racks have been developed to lower the ladder to waist height but most commonly the fire fighters simply lift the ladder off of the rack and proceed to the fire,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;76;Ladders like pumps are also purchased from other suppliers and installed by the apparatus builder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;77;Once the body has been assembled to the truck frame the equipment mounting holes are located and drilled and any additional holes or passages are cut into the panels,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;78;This allows the painting operation to seal the exposed edges of holes and other openings,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;79;The exterior of the apparatus is washed and sanded in preparation for painting,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;80;The interior of the doors and compartments have already been painted,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;81;The outside can be painted in matching colors,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;82;The painting process includes a primer surfacer to fill small sanding marks and surface defects and a sealer to improve paint adhesion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;83;Fire trucks used to be all red but some experiments with yellow blue and white have been done to increase visual identification,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;84;Today the NFPA recommends yellow or the standard Fire Engine Red,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;85;The type of paint is usually a tough enamel or synthetic to resist burning embers and wear from fire service,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;86;Hardening agents are added to the paint to improve the shine and durability,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;87;After painting the ladders and accessories can be installed using stainless steel fasteners,Relevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;88;The modern fire apparatus can be complicated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;89;Radio systems cellular phones computers and cellular fax machines are all finding their way into the fire service,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;90;Even our example apparatus will require several hundred feet of wiring to operate the warning lights siren radios bay lights generator flood lights pump electricals and other systems,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;91;Most apparatuses have two independent battery systems which must be wired into the apparatus after painting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fire Engine;92;The pump operators control panel containing the pressure gauges and valves used to control the pump will also be installed,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;1;The ingredients used to prepare stars are obtained from chemical supply companies and stored in barrels,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;2;At the time of mixing the chemicals are scooped out of the barrels weighed and sifted twice through brass screens to remove lumps,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;3;(Brass is used because it does not produce sparks),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;4;The sifted powders are placed on a large sheet of paper and gently mixed by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;5;The powders may also be mixed inside a rotating drum or a stationary container with rotating paddles,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;6;These devices must be used with great care to avoid generating heat through friction or trapping bits of powder between moving parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;7;The mixed powder is placed in barrels and taken from the mixing room to the cutting room,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;8;Water is mixed with it to form a soft dough,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;9;Lumps of the dough are scooped into large paperlined wooden molds shaped like loaves of bread,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;10;The dough is packed firmly into the mold with a wooden mallet,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;11;(The wet dough is much safer to manipulate than the dry powder),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;12;The loaves of dough weighing about 35 pounds (16 kg) each are unmolded onto a workbench covered with heavy cardboard sprinkled with black powder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;13;The loaves are cut in one direction to form slices then cut in the other direction to form dice,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;14;The dimensions of the dice may be anywhere from 0062 inches (0165 cm),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;17;The black powder adheres to the wet dice and will help them burn when the firework is ignited,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;18;The dice are allowed to dry on papercovered screens,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;19;The dried dice are now stars,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;20;They are moved to the packing room to be placed into cardboard containers,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;21;A hollow cardboard tube is placed in the center of the cylindrical container and stars are gently poured around it,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;22;A large container may hold as many as 900 stars (about 44 pounds [2 kg]),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;24;When the container is full black powder is poured inside the hollow tube and the tube is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;25;The powder fills the spaces between the stars and will serve to ignite and scatter them,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;26;A paper cap is placed on the filled container now called a break,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;27;The break is wrapped with heavy string a process known as spiking,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;28;Spiking is done by tying one end of a large spool of string to the break and winding the string around it,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;29;When the break is completely covered the string is cut and tied,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;30;Some breaks are not spiked but are made instead of plastic or heavier cardboard to withstand the stress of being launched,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;31;A time fuse (a short slowburning fuse that causes the break to explode a certain amount of time after it is launched) is inserted into the break and it is wrapped in heavy paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;32;The wrapped breaks are moved to the pasting room to be wrapped in heavy pastesoaked paper then allowed to dry for about two days,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;33;The paper hardens as the paste dries to form a strong tight seal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;34;Some breaks known as salutes are filled with flash powder rather than stars and black powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;35;Flash powder is mixed in much the same way as the chemicals used to make stars,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;36;It is then poured into cardboard containers that are thicker and stronger than other breaks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;37;This allows more pressure to build up before the salute bursts resulting in a louder bang,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;38;These salutes are then spiked and pasted like other breaks,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;39;The dry breaks are moved to the finishing room to be assembled into shells,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;40;The simplest shells consist of a small compartment of black powder combined with a single break,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;41;Due to their spherical structure Asian shells always contain only one break,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;42;Because American and European shells are cylindrical more than one break can be stacked together so that the shell will display multiple bursts of different colors when it explodes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;43;Multibreak shells usually consist of a small compartment of black powder three or four colored breaks and a salute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;44;Some large shells contain as many as 10 breaks and at least one gigantic shell has been made holding 22 breaks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;45;The shell is assembled by stacking the components together attaching a starting fuse (a long fastburning fuse used to ignite the black powder that launches the firework) wrapping them in heavy paper and tying the package together with string,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;46;The completed firework is then labeled and stored until needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;47;Small fireworks intended for private use are made in much the same way as large ones but they are generally simpler in construction and contain much less explosive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;48;Small fireworks include firecrackers (paper tubes holding a small amount of explosive) fountains (paper cones filled with chemicals which release colored sparks) and Roman candles (long paper tubes filled with a small amount of explosive and several small stars which shoot out one at a time),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;49;Some small fireworks contain no explosive at all and may be as simple as a single chemical wrapped in paper or foil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;50;Examples include smoke balls (filled with a chemical that releases colored smoke) and snakes (filled with ammonium dichromate which slowly burns and produces a long trail of ash),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;51;Sparklers are made by dipping a metal wire in a slurry containing a fuel an oxidizer a coloring agent and aluminum granules which provide the sparks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;52;Professional fireworks are usually launched by the same companies who make them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;53;If a set piece (a groundbased display that forms a picture or words with colored flares called lances) is to be used the design to be formed is sketched on graph paper and sent to carpenters who build a wooden frame with thin wooden slats in the shape of the design,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;54;If music will accompany the fireworks the timing of the display is planned to match the tempo of the music,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;55;Several hours before the show begins (or a few days in advance for a very large show) the crew arrives with all the necessary equipment including fire extinguishers and first aid kits,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;56;Mortars to launch the shells are placed in their proper places,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;57;Large ones are placed in holes dug in the ground or in steel drums filled with sand,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;58;Smaller mortars are placed in wooden racks,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;59;The proper shell for each mortar is loaded in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;60;The frames for set pieces are assembled lances are attached to the slats and fuses are attached to the lances,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;61;When the display begins the lances and mortars are lit at the proper times either with long handheld flares or with electrical wires attached to a central switchboard,Relevant
MadeHow;Fireworks;62;After the show the crew safely destroys any unexploded duds,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;1;The ingredients for fortune cookies are mixed together to form the batter,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;2;This watery dough is transferred by a pump to the fortune cookie oven which is circular and contains a number of shallow cups with flat bottoms (about 3 inches [76 cm] in diameter) in the shape of the finished but unfolded cookie,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;3;When the cups are filled with the correct amount of dough as regulated by the batter pump flat metal plates are placed in the cups on top of the dough,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;4;The plates flatten the dough and also allow heat to transfer through the metal surfaces against both the top and bottom of the cookie so it is golden brown on both sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;5;The cookies rotate through the circular oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;6;One complete orbit takes 35 minutes which is the time it takes the thin dough to bake,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;7;In a variation of this method the dough is poured on a griddle and the round shapes are stamped out by metal forms,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;8;When the cookie has finished baking it sticks to the plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;9;As the plates are lifted up a mechanical arm snatches the cookie from the plate and transfers it to a receiving area where the fortunes are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;10;The paper strips are sucked by vacuum onto the cookies,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;11;The cookies are pushed along to two mechanical fingers that grab the still hot cookie and fold it in half so it resembles a halfmoon with the paper fortune inside,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;12;The machine then bends the cookie in the middle to its familiar crescent shape (which has been fancifully described as a pair of water wings a fan or an extracted molar!) The formed cookie is then cooled by air from a fan and pushed to the packaging area,Relevant
MadeHow;Fortune Cookie;13;Cookies are packed in small bags for store sale or large bags for restaurant use and the bags are placed in cartons to protect their fragile cargo,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;1;A freezedrying processing facility is usually a large plant with modern equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;2;Its foodhandling areas must be approved by the United States Department of Agriculture and the company and its employees must adhere to government regulatory procedures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;3;The plant may include a receiving and storage area for raw foods that arrive at the plant in bulk a food cooking area for those foods that must be cooked before processing a large area with several large freezing and drying chambers and a packaging area,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;4;The facility may also include a research area where improved methods of freezedrying foods are developed and a test kitchen where new preparation techniques to improve the final taste quality and texture of the food are tried,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;5;Some plants are dedicated to freezedrying only one product like freezedried coffee,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;6;Others process a wide range of meats vegetables and fruits,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;7;Nonfood products such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals are usually processed in separate plants from food products,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;8;The freezedrying process varies in the details of temperatures times pressures and intermediate steps from one food to another,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;9;The following is a generalized description of the process with several specific exceptions noted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;10;The food is first checked for contamination and purity,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;11;Fruits meats and some other edibles are tested for bacterial counts and spoilage,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;12;Much of the work of the plant is dependent on the harvest season for each food,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;13;In January for example the plant would be processing celery olives lemons oranges and pineapples,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;14;In July it would process green beans peas and strawberries among others,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;15;Some kinds of food like seafood and meats must be cooked before freeze drying,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;16;They are usually purchased already cut into small pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;17;If they have not been precooked and frozen these foods are placed in large industrialsized kettles and properly cooked,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;18;Fruits and vegetables are usually purchased already cut pitted and peeled,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;19;These foods are simply washed with sprays of water,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;20;Some vegetables like peas and corn are quickly scalded or blanched before freezing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;21;Coffee is purchased as a prebrewed concentrated liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;22;Because the aroma of coffee is important to consumers a small amount of coffee bean oil may be added to the liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;23;Unlike the water the oil is not removed during the drying process,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;24;The food pieces are spread out on flat metal trays which are stacked 20 to 30 high in slots in a wheeled cart,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;25;With food that has been precooked and frozen the trays are prechilled to prevent partial thawing during handling,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;26;With liquids like coffee the prebrewed coffee is poured into shallow pans,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;27;The carts are wheeled into a large walkin coldroom where the temperature can be as low as 40°F (40°C),Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;28;In this extremely cold temperature the food is quickly frozen,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;29;There are usually a dozen or more coldrooms in operation and the carts are kept there until it is time to move them into the drying chamber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;30;The carts are wheeled out of the coldroom and into a vacuum drying chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;31;In the case of liquids like coffee the frozen coffee is first ground up into small particles in a lowtemperature grinder,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;32;The drying chamber is a large long horizontal cylinder with semielliptical ends,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;33;One end is hinged to open and close,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;34;When the trays of frozen food pieces are inside the chamber is closed and sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;35;In a large plant there may be 20 to 30 drying chambers in operation at any time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;36;The drying procedure involves a process known as sublimation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;37;In sublimation a solid material is forced to change state into a gaseous material without ever becoming a liquid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;38;In the case of freezedried food the solid ice crystals trapped in the frozen food pieces are forced to change into water vapor without ever becoming liquid water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;39;In the drying chamber this is accomplished by evacuating the air with a vacuum pump to reduce the pressure to about 0036 psi (00025 bar),Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;40;The temperature of the food is raised to about 100°F (38°C) by direct conduction through the bottom of the trays radiation from heat lamps or microwave heating,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;41;When the chamber is evacuated of air the pressure is below the threshold at which water can simultaneously exist in a solid liquid and gaseous (vapor) state,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;42;This threshold is known as the triple point of water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;43;Once the pressure falls below this point the heat causes the ice crystals trapped in the frozen pieces of food to change directly to water vapor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;44;The vapor is drawn off and condensed within the chamber leaving the food behind,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;45;The dried food is filled with tiny voids like a sponge where the ice crystals were once present,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;46;Not only does this make it easier for the food to reabsorb water when it is prepared for consumption but the dried food retains its original size and shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;47;The time for this drying process varies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;48;Freezedried liquids make take only about four hours to prepare while semisolids and solids like soup and sliced meats may take 12 hours or more,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;49;The dried food pieces are removed from the drying chamber and tested for moisture content and purity,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;50;Some food pieces may be ground to a smaller size or may be reduced to a powder,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;51;Others may be screened to separate them by size,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;52;Two or more different products may also be blended together to meet a customers specific specifications,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;53;Freezedried foods must be sealed in airtight containers to prevent them from absorbing moisture from the air,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;54;Several types of containers may be used plastic laminated foil pouches metal and plastic cans or metal and fiber drums for bulk packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;55;Some freezedried food is vacuum packed in which the air is evacuated from the container before sealing,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;56;Other food has an inert gas like nitrogen injected into the container before sealing to displace the oxygen in the air and prevent oxidation or spoiling of the food,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;57;The packaging is done in the freezedry plant almost as soon as the foods come out of the drying chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;58;The plant can form fill and seal the packages to the desired weight for the end user,Irrelevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;59;Packages that are to be sold directly to the consumer are packed in cartons stacked on pallets and transported to the grocery warehouse,Relevant
MadeHow;FreezeDried Food;60;Other freezedried food is packaged in bulk and sold to a secondary processor for incorporation into other food products,Relevant

MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;3;Liquid and dry ingredients are combined separately,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;4;The liquids are poured into a vat mixed together and heated,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;5;Next the dry ingredients are added to the liquids in a particular order,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;6;Meanwhile the batch is stiffed and the temperature gradually increased,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;7;Most ingredients must be incorporated before the mix is heated to 120°F (49°C) so that the mix does not become lumpy,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;8;The mixture must be heated to dissolve and blend the ingredients,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;9;Pasteurizing the batch is necessary to destroy pathogenic bacteria and to help preserve the finished product,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;10;It is also required by law in most regions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;11;Pasteurization is a simple process that involves quickly bringing the mix to a high temperature for a specified time and then quickly reducing the temperature to less than 40°F (4°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;12;The trend in the industry has been toward increasing the pasteurization temperature to about 175°F (79°C) for about 2540 seconds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;13;For greater results batches can be pasteurized at temperatures as high as 210°F (99°C) to 220°F (104°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;14;These high temperatures also improve the flavor and help blend the ingredients more effectively,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;15;Homogenizing the batch makes it smoother primarily by decreasing the size of fat globules to less than two micrometers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;16;Without homogenization fat could rise to the top of the mixture and create a layer of cream,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;17;Homogenization consists of pumping the batch through a small valve and against an impact ring,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;18;Three forces are at work,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;19;As the mix passes at a high velocity of about 30000 fpm (feet per minute) through the valve shear forces begin to break up the fat particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;20;The impact ring ruptures the fat further,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;21;Completing the process is cavitation in which vapor bubbles are created by a sudden discharge of pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;22;Within the bubbles the fat droplets crash against the vapor walls and disintegrate thus the more fat the more homogenization required,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;23;While the temperature of the mix is 90°F (32°C) it is inoculated with 1 yogurt culture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;24;The mix remains at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;25;After homogenization the mixture must be cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;26;If it is cooled slowly from about 90°F (32°C) to about 40°F (4°C) the mix will become more viscous,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;27;Once the temperature falls between 32°F (0°C) and 40°F (4°C) the batch is stored in aging tanks inside coolers,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;28;The mix is aged for up to four hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;29;The final ingredients are mixed together in a flavor vat,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;30;These include sweeteners flavorings and coloring,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;31;This mixture is then pumped into the freezer with the rest of the mixture which is about 20°F (6°C) to 28°F (2°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;32;While the mix is hardening it is agitated to incorporate air and create overrun or excess volume,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;33;The addition of air also smoothes the consistency and creates a more palatable product,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;34;In about three minutes the mix begins to freeze and within a few more minutes the desired overrun about 50 is achieved,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;35;About one to twothirds of the water freezes during this stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;36;After the desired overrun is reached the mixture is packaged and placed in freezers where the freezing process continues,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;37;The temperature falls quickly within one or two minutes to at least 0°F (17°C) but ideally 15°F (26°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;38;For best results the freezing process should occur rapidly so that the mixture does not form large coarse ice crystals but small smooth ones,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;39;The frozen yogurt may be stored in continuous or batch freezers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;40;In the former there is a constant flow of product into the freezer while in the batch method batches are prepared individually,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;41;Depending on the type of freezer and the size and shape of the package the final hardening takes between 30 minutes to 12 hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;42;The containers of frozen yogurt are piled closely together inside the delivery trucks to minimize the temperature change during shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;43;The vehicles are generally mechanically refrigerated at the same temperatures as in the storage facilities in the factory about 15°F (26°C) and not above the temperature at the retail outlet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;44;Dry ice may be used as a refrigerant though it risks heatshock to the yogurt which occurs if the temperature falls too low the freezing point for dry ice is 109°F (78°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Frozen Yogurt;45;The frozen yogurt is shipped to retail outlets and food service establishments or to other manufacturers for further processing into novelties,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;1;The first step in the manufacture of gasoline is to find its parent ingredient petroleum,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;2;Crude oil is trapped in areas of porous rock or reservoir rock after it has migrated there from the area of its origin,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;3;Possible areas of oil concentration may be pinpointed by looking for rock types that are commonly found in those areas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;4;Explorers may examine the surface features of the land analyze how sound waves bounce off the rock or use a gravity meter to detect slight differences in rock formations,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;5;Gasoline is a volatile flammable liquid obtained from the refinement of petroleum or crude oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;6;After a possible oil reservoir is found the area must be test drilled,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;7;Core samples are taken from test wells to confirm rock formations and the samples are chemically analyzed in order to determine if more drilling is justified,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;8;Although the methods used today are more advanced than any of the past there is still no certainty in oil exploration,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;9;Crude oil is recovered through wells that can reach over 1000 feet (305 m) into the rock,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;10;The holes are made by rotary drillers which use a bit to bore a hole in the ground as water is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;11;The water and soil create a thick mud that helps hold back the oil and prevent it from gushing due to the internal pressure contained in the reservoir rock,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;12;When the reservoir is reached the mud continues to hold back the oil while the drill is removed and a pipe is inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;13;To recover the oil a complicated system of pipes and valving is installed directly into the drilling well,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;14;The natural pressure of the reservoir rock brings the oil out of the well and into the pipes,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;15;These are connected to a recovery system which consists of a series of larger pipes taking the crude oil to the refinery via an oil (liquid) and gas (nonliquid) separator,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;16;This method allows the oil to be recovered with a minimum of waste,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;17;Eventually the natural pressure of the well is expended though great quantities of oil may still remain in the rock,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;18;Secondary recovery methods are now required to obtain a greater percentage of the oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;19;The pressure is restored by either injecting gas into the pocket above the oil or by flooding water into the well which is far more common,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;20;In this process four holes are drilled around the perimeter of the well and water is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;21;The petroleum will float on the water and come to the surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;22;Crude oil is not a good fuel since it is not fluid and requires a very high temperature to burn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;23;The long chains of molecules in crude oil must be separated from the smaller chains of refined fuels including gasoline in a petroleum refinery,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;24;This process is called fractional distillation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;25;A fractional distillation tower is a huge unit that may hold up to 200000 barrels of crude oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;26;The oil is first pumped into a furnace and heated to over 600°F (316°C) causing all but the largest molecules to evaporate,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;27;The vapors rise into the fractionating column which may be as tall as 150 feet (46 m),Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;28;The vapors cool as they rise through the column,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;29;Since the boiling points of all the compounds differ the larger heavier molecules will condense first lower in the tower and the shorter lighter molecules will condense higher in the tower,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;30;Natural gases gasoline and kerosene are released near the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;31;Heavier compounds used in the manufacture of plastics and lubricants are removed lower in the tower,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;32;Fractional distillation itself does not produce gasoline from crude oil it just removes the gasoline from other compounds in crude oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;33;Further refining processes are now used to improve the quality of the fuel,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;34;Catalytic cracking is one of the most important processes in oil refining,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;35;This process uses a catalyst high temperature and increased pressure to affect chemical changes in petroleum,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;36;Catalysts such as aluminum platinum processed clay and acids are added to petroleum to break down larger molecules so that it will possess the desired compounds of gasoline,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;37;Another refining process is polymerization,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;38;This is the opposite of cracking in that it combines the smaller molecules of lighter gases into larger ones that can be used as liquid fuels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;39;Once gasoline is refined chemicals are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;40;Some are antiknock compounds which react with the chemicals in gasoline that burn too quickly to prevent engine knock,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;41;In leaded gasoline tetraethyl lead is the antiknock additive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;42;(Unleaded gasoline is refined further so the need for antiknock additives is minimal),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;43;Other additives (antioxidants) are added to prevent the formation of gum in the engine,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;44;Gum is a resin formed in gasoline that can coat the internal parts of the engine and increase wear,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;45;Gasoline is primarily a mixture of two volatile liquids heptane and isooctane,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;46;Pure heptane a lighter fuel burns so quickly that it produces a great amount of knocking in an engine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;47;Pure isooctane evaporates slowly and produces virtually no knocking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;48;The ratio of heptane to isooctane is measured by the octane rating,Relevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;49;The greater the percentage of isooctane the less knocking and the higher the octane rating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gasoline;50;For example an octane rating of 87 is comparable to a mixture of 87 isooctane and 13 heptane,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;1;The outer skin covers and shields of the baler are punched or blanked out of sheet steel in a large punch press or by laser cutter,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;2;The sheet metal can be taken directly from the roll or precut into flat sheets as needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;3;Punch presses operate by forcing a hardened steel punch through the material into a hardened die with up to 200 tons of force,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;4;This shears the metal to size and the rapid stroke of the punch press allows many parts to be produced per hour,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;5;More intricate shapes and lowvolume parts are cut using an industrial laser to burn through the metal in a preprogrammed pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;6;In spite of being slower than the punch press the laser reduces material waste by arranging the part shapes to most effectively utilize the sheet size,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;7;Another advantage of the laser cutter is that it requires practically no set up which means it can create differentsized parts without physically adapting the machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;8;This is important as one machine can then produce hundreds of different parts in any random order and provide them to the rest of the manufacturing process as needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;9;Balers are constructed primarily of structural and sheet steel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;10;This steel can be in bar stock sheets or in rolls,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;11;Hydraulic cylinders pumps wheels and tires belts and other components are purchased from suppliers and shipped to the baler assembly plant,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;12;Bar stock steel that is used for frames shafts arms and other structural parts is cut using a band saw,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;13;These saws have many toothed cutting blades driven over two large wheels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;14;The wheels rotate and move the blade continuously to cut through the bar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;15;Bar stock can be round square rectangular solid or hollow plus many other shapes specific to the desired application,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;16;After cutting to length holes and slots are drilled punched or milled into the parts as needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;17;Structural parts are usually fabricated close to the welding area to minimize time between operations,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;18;Welding is performed primarily by robotic welders,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;19;These machines are operated by a computer that has been programmed to move the welding electrode wire through a specific range of motion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;20;The robotic welder is very accurate and makes highquality repeatable welds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;21;After the various components are clamped into a large welding fixture by the operator the robot extends a short piece of welding wire from the welding gun,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;22;With the welding current turned off it gently touches a computer sensor that accurately defines the exact position of the wire tip,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;23;Then the robot touches the tip of the wire to each of the components in two or three places,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;24;All of this touching is actually transmitting data to the computer about the exact location of the components in reference to the desired location of the weld,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;25;Once complete the computer program compensates slightly for any deviation from the exact position,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;26;The welding current is turned on and the wire is fed into the arc while the robot moves the gun along the joint,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;27;This insures that the welds will be exactly at the proper place and achieve the highest possible strength,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;28;It also prevents welding any misplaced or incorrect parts reducing scrap and possible machine failures,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;29;In many critical applications robotic welders can be more accurate than a human welder because of this type of programming,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;30;After welding fabricated parts as well as shields and covers are cleaned and painted,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;31;Cleaning is accomplished by hot steam or solvents inside an enclosure,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;32;The paint is applied by dipping the parts into an electrostatic paint tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;33;These tanks are large enough to submerge an entire baler frame typically 15 feet (45 m) long and 10 feet (3 m) wide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;34;They contain 2000040000 gallons (75700151400 1) of paint,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;35;The paint is suspended in a water solution and charged with a negative electric charge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;36;The parts are charged positive and when the parts submerge into the solution the electrical attraction of the two charges sticks the paint tightly to the metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;37;The parts are hoisted out of the tank and allowed to drip before they are placed into a drying oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;38;This drying oven heats the parts to approximately 365°F (185°C) which bakes the paint into a hard finish,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;39;Because balers are used and sometimes stored outside a good finish is needed to protect the steel from rusting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;40;The hay enters the baler through the pickup,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;41;Directly behind the pickup is the compressor bar which holds the hay in place so the auger can feed it into the bale chamber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;42;The bale chamber contains a plunger that drive in and out each time packing and compressing hay into the desired shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;43;After painting the frame of the baler is placed onto a wheeled cart,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;44;This allows the baler to be moved and assembled at a variety of work stations each adding specific components and performing quality checks during production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;45;The hydraulics pickup tines bale tensioners knotters and subassemblies are bolted into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;46;Many design features create special hole patterns tabs pins notches and other forms to prevent the parts from being assembled in the wrong place or position,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;47;After assembly the hydraulic systems are filled with oil belt and chain tensions are adjusted and the bearings greased,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;48;The baler then has the tire and wheel assemblies mounted and identifying decals and stickers attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;49;Since a baler can be a very dangerous machine many warning labels are applied to caution operators to keep their hands away from the moving parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;50;Finished balers are finally inspected and operated without hay to check the functionality of all the parts,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;51;Most are shipped by truck or railcar to dealers all over the world,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;52;A technician may be sent out to the field with the new baler to instruct the operator and make final adjustments,Relevant
MadeHow;Hay Baler;53;Often changes in the hay crop will require occasional adjustment to the baler to produce quality bales,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;1;Before fabrication begins the user is screened by a trained professional,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;2;The screening includes a hearing test and the results are used to create an audiogram covering a variety of parameters,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;3;At the screening stage an impression or mold of the users outer ear is also taken,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;4;The audiogram and the impression are integral to the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;5;All order data—desired product features and the results of the audiogram—are entered in a computer to determine the operating range for the hearing aid specifically which levels of amplification are required for the user,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;6;For some manufacturers the computer also selects the electronic circuitry to be used,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;7;Typically an order card will be prepared and sent to the production line along with the ear impression,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;8;A parts card is also printed and sent to the stock room where the various components are stored,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;9;In this step a form or reverse copy of the impression of the outer ear and ear canal is produced,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;10;A sheet of clear vinyl is placed over the impression then heat is applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;11;When cooled the impression is removed from the vinyl form and trimmed,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;12;Next the impression is dipped in hot wax giving it a smooth paperthin coating for the casting step,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;13;Here a technician will place the impression on a metal plate and place rings around it,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;14;A clear liquid colloid or particle suspension is poured into the rings immersing the impression,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;15;The liquid is allowed to cure into a rubbery silicone consistency,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;16;Lastly the impression is pulled out of the gel,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;17;The shell or outer casing of the hearing aid is made from this mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;18;The mold is first heated in 110°F (43°C) water and air is blown through it to clear away any impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;19;At this point a technician will mix liquid acrylic of equal parts monomer and polymer (for a structurally sound shell) and add the desired pigment to give the shell a pink tan or brown color,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;20;The technician pours the liquid into the heated colloid mold and after ten seconds pours off any excess leaving a thin acrylic shell inside the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;21;After 10 minutes of cooling the technician pulls from the mold a shell that is a perfect replica of the raw impression of the ear canal,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;22;After a technician grinds off the excess flanges from the shell he will add a vent or opening,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;23;A small piece of silicon wire shaped to the vent size is run through the inside of the shell and pulled out,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;24;The technician drills holes into the canal end of the shell for the receiver tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;25;After that the outside of the shell will be buffed to a smooth shiny finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;26;A technician will size the shell for a face plate or flange—the area that will be exposed outside the ear canal—using the vacuum form from the original impression,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;27;The plate will be carefully set at the correct angle for the users ear,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;28;The components and circuits are run on a ceramic substrate base of various designs,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;29;The substrate is made by a screen printing technique that alternates layers of conductive and insulating materials depending on the engineered design,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;30;The conducting layer contains gold and silver and the insulating layers contain silicon compounds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;31;Between the printing of each layer the substrate is passed by a conveyor through a furnace where it bakes for two hours at 850°F (454°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;32;This seals the layers and creates the color patterns characteristic of printed circuit boards only on a smaller scale,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;33;The various electronic components are bonded by hand to the gold and silver parts on both sides of the substrate,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;34;A technician will interconnect the devices using gold wire of 001 inch (025 mm) thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;35;Lastly the components are sealed in an epoxy paste and heathardened,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;36;Working from the parts card or bill of materials determined at the outset of production a technician assembles the electronic hardware on the face plate where holes have been drilled for mounting the microphone amplifier battery compartment and volume control all handwired with colors for traceability,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;37;The wires are soldered into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;38;After this the receiver is mounted into the shell and a preliminary hearing check made on the instrument,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;39;In the final production steps the parts are carefully packaged to avoid interferences,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;40;A plastic cement is brushed on while the technician performs a listening check to make sure there is no oscillation in the sound quality,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;41;Once the cement dries excess face plate is cut away and the remaining edge ground off with a hand lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;42;Finally the aid is buffed and shined to a high gloss and manufacturing is complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Hearing Aid;43;The aid is now ready for final testing,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;1;The blade begins as a blank cut from flat material that is in a soft condition which means it has not been heat treated,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;2;Massproduced knives are stamped in a punch press using a hardened punch and die shaped to match the outline of the blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;3;The punch is forced through the material into the die blanking the rough blade into shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;4;Custom knives may be cut out with a saw or an industrial laser may be used to cut especially intricate blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;5;The most important part of the modern hunting knife the blade is made of steel or stainless steel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;6;Of particular importance is the carbon content of the metal which determines the hardness of the blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;7;After the blank is cut holes for the handle stocks are drilled into the tang,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;8;Rough shaping is also performed by grinding or machining,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;9;This shaping forms the thickness of the blade at various points and reduces the amount of finish grinding on the sharp edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;10;Any identifying markings or decorative details are stamped while the blade is in a soft condition,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;11;The blade is hardened to preserve the sharpness of the knife edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;12;Each blade material may require different hardening and heattreating methods however common steel blades are generally heat treated in the following manner,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;13;To harden the blade several blades are placed into a ceramic tray in a heattreating oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;14;They are laid flat so the weight of the blades does not cause warping,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;15;Depending upon the specific requirements of the alloy the temperature in the oven is raised to approximately 1600°F (871°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;16;After heating the blades for approximately two hours the entire tray is removed from the oven and the blades are submerged in oil or water,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;17;This rapidly cools the blades and is called quenching,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;18;The quenching locks the metal crystals into an intricate microscopic pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;19;This process also results in the metal becoming very brittle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;20;After quenching the blades are reheated to approximately 500°F (260°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;21;At this point the metal has a slight darkreddish color and the crystals change their alignment slightly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;22;Then the blades are allowed to cool slowly in a process called tempering,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;23;This toughens the metal while retaining some of the brittleness needed for fine sharpening,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;24;Further heating and cooling cycles may be used to harden other specialized alloys,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;25;After the heattreated blades are cool they are polished and sharpened,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;26;Polishing is performed by machine or by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;27;A flat belt sander is used to produce a smooth even brushed finish to the sides of the blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;28;This also polishes out any marks from the punch press operation and removes the surface residue from the heattreat operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;29;Next the blade is placed into a grinding fixture that passes it through a series of grinding wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;30;Each rotating wheel removes the correct amount of metal to form the edge relief point rough edge angle and other features of the working portion of the blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;31;When utility knives are made many of these features are left without further finishing since they are for functional rather than cosmetic purposes,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;32;In the case of fancier knives these features may be hand polished using a rotating buffing wheel and jewelers rouge,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;33;The rouge is a soft abrasive paste which when spread onto the cotton buffing wheel and then buffed against the blade surface polishes the metal to a high luster,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;34;When the blade is finished with these steps it will be quite sharp and may appear ready to use,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;35;However the final sharpening steps are required to produce a longlasting edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;36;To the casual observer the knife edge appears as simply the result of two intersecting surfaces,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;37;Upon closer examination the true form of the edge is seen to consist of two distinctly separate sets of angles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;38;The first is left by the rough grinding as explained above while the second is the fine angle that actually forms the cutting edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;39;This edge is produced by a fine grinding operation called honing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;40;The angle of the hone may be between 17 and 30 degrees to the axis of the blade depending upon the blade application,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;41;A smaller angle will produce a sharper edge but the edge will wear and become dull more quickly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;42;A fine grinding hone or stone is oiled and gently rubbed on the knife edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;43;This action produces the finest sharpened edge and is the only true method of properly sharpening a knife blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;44;When viewed under a microscope the rough ground edge appears as a series of jagged points,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;45;While sharp enough to cut adequately in this condition the points wear easily and soon the sharpness is gone,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;46;By honing these points are blended into a consistent edge of equal sharpness,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;47;The stocks are riveted or pressed onto the tang of the knife blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;48;A buffing wheel is used to smooth the stocks and blend the rivet heads,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;49;In the case of a leather handle the washer segments are stacked onto the tang starting at the guard,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;50;After the handle length is filled with leather the pommel is pressed onto the end of the tang and secured with a pin or rivet,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;51;This squeezes the leather together making a tight easily gripped handle,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;52;The leather may be shaped using a grinding wheel and then sealed with a penetrating sealer,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;53;The guard and pommel can then be finished by polishing with the buffing wheel,Relevant
MadeHow;Hunting Knife;54;Great care must be taken during the assembly and finishing process as not to damage the knife blade or ruin the sharp edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Ice Skates;1;The leather or nylon is fed into a cutting machine that stamps out eight standardized pieces four for the boot lining and four for the boot upper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ice Skates;2;A similar machine cuts pieces for the tongue sole heel and reinforcement sections,Relevant
MadeHow;Ice Skates;3;The pieces are mechanically punched with a date code size order number and eyelet holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Ice Skates;4;The boot is sewn together on industrial sewing machines that the plant workers regulate with foot pedals or control panels,Relevant

MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;1;Hundreds of integrated circuits are made at the same time on a single thin slice of silicon and are then cut apart into individual IC chips,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;2;The manufacturing process takes place in a tightly controlled environment known as a clean room where the air is filtered to remove foreign particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;3;The few equipment operators in the room wear lintfree garments gloves and coverings for their heads and feet,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;4;Since some IC components are sensitive to certain frequencies of light even the light sources are filtered,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;5;Although manufacturing processes may vary depending on the integrated circuit being made the following process is typical,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;6;A cylindrical ingot of silicon about 15 to 40 inches (38 to 102 cm) in diameter is held vertically inside a vacuum chamber with a hightemperature heating coil encircling it,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;11;Starting at the top of the cylinder the silicon is heated to its melting point of about 2550°F (1400°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;12;To avoid contamination the heated region is contained only by the surface tension of the molten silicon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;13;As the region melts any impurities in the silicon become mobile,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;14;The heating coil is slowly moved down the length of the cylinder and the impurities are carried along with the melted region,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;15;When the heating coil reaches the bottom almost all of the impurities have been swept along and are concentrated there,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;16;The bottom is then sliced off leaving a cylindrical ingot of purified silicon,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;17;A thin round wafer of silicon is cut off the ingot using a precise cutting machine called a wafer slicer,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;18;Each slice is about 001 to 0025 inches (0004 to 001 cm) thick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;23;The surface on which the integrated circuits are to be formed is polished,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;24;The surfaces of the wafer are coated with a layer of silicon dioxide to form an insulating base and to prevent any oxidation of the silicon which would cause impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;25;The silicon dioxide is formed by subjecting the wafer to superheated steam at about 1830°F (1000°C) under several atmospheres of pressure to allow the oxygen in the water vapor to react with the silicon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;26;Controlling the temperature and length of exposure controls the thickness of the silicon dioxide layer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;27;The complex and interconnected design of the circuits and components is prepared in a process similar to that used to make printed circuit boards,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;28;For ICs however the dimensions are much smaller and there are many layers superimposed on top of each other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;29;The design of each layer is prepared on a computeraided drafting machine and the image is made into a mask which will be optically reduced and transferred to the surface of the wafer,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;30;The mask is opaque in certain areas and clear in others,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;31;It has the images for all of the several hundred integrated circuits to be formed on the wafer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;32;A drop of photoresist material is placed in the center of the silicon wafer and the wafer is spun rapidly to distribute the photoresist over the entire surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;33;The photoresist is then baked to remove the solvent,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;34;The coated wafer is then placed under the first layer mask and irradiated with light,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;35;Because the spaces between circuits and components are so small ultraviolet light with a very short wavelength is used to squeeze through the tiny clear areas on the mask,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;36;Beams of electrons or xrays are also sometimes used to irradiate the photoresist,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;37;The mask is removed and portions of the photoresist are dissolved,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;38;If a positive photoresist was used then the areas that were irradiated will be dissolved,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;39;If a negative photoresist was used then the areas that were irradiated will remain,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;40;The uncovered areas are then either chemically etched to open up a layer or are subjected to chemical doping to create a layer of P or N regions,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;41;One method of adding dopants to create a layer of P or N regions is atomic diffusion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;42;In this method a batch of wafers is placed in an oven made of a quartz tube surrounded by a heating element,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;43;The wafers are heated to an operating temperature of about 15002200°F (8161205°C) and the dopant chemical is carried in on an inert gas,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;44;As the dopant and gas pass over the wafers the dopant is deposited on the hot surfaces left exposed by the masking process,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;45;This method is good for doping relatively large areas but is not accurate for smaller areas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;46;There are also some problems with the repeated use of high temperatures as successive layers are added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;47;The second method to add dopants is ion implantation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;48;In this method a dopant gas like phosphine or boron trichloride is ionized to provide a beam of highenergy dopant ions which are fired at specific regions of the wafer,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;49;The ions penetrate the wafer and remain implanted,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;50;The depth of penetration can be controlled by altering the beam energy and the amount of dopant can be controlled by altering the beam current and time of exposure,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;51;Schematically the whole process resembles firing a beam in a bent cathoderay tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;52;This method is so precise it does not require masking—it just points and shoots the dopant where it is needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;53;However it is much slower than the atomic diffusion process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;54;The process of masking and etching or doping is repeated for each successive layer depending on the doping process used until all of the integrated circuit chips are complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;55;Sometimes a layer of silicon dioxide is laid down to provide an insulator between layers or components,Relevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;56;This is done through a process known as chemical vapor deposition in which the wafers surface is heated to about 752°F (400°C) and a reaction between the gases silane and oxygen deposits a layer of silicon dioxide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Integrated Circuit;57;A final silicon dioxide layer seals the surface a final etching opens up contact points and a layer of aluminum is deposited to make the contact pads,Relevant

MadeHow;Iron;8;The melted iron sinks to the bottom of the furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;9;The limestone combines with the rock and other impurities in the ore to form a slag which is lighter than the iron and floats on top,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;10;As the volume of the charge is reduced more is continually added at the top of the furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;11;The iron and slag are drawn off separately from the bottom of the furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;12;The melted iron might go to a further alloying process or might be cast into ingots called pigs,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;13;The slag is carried away for disposal,Relevant
MadeHow;Iron;14;The hot gases produced in the chemical reactions are drawn off at the top and routed to a gas cleaning plant where they are cleaned or scrubbed and sent back into the furnace the remaining carbon monoxide in particular is useful to the chemical reactions going on within the furnace,Relevant

MadeHow;Jelly Bean;5;The chemists also develop new flavors with an eye toward the consumers interest in natural products and they evaluate its nutrition facts including ingredients and caloric content,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;6;After the chemists have finetuned their recipe the candy kitchen creates the syrup that forms the jelly bean center by dissolving the sugar and other ingredients in large boilers where the syrup is cooked to the proper temperature and consistency,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;7;Flavor and color for the bean center are added to the syrup which is then piped to the starch casting area,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;8;The kitchens also mix and cook the flavor and color syrups for the panning process described below,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;9;These syrups are carefully transported to the panning room and are added in measured doses during panning,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;10;Formation or shaping of a single jelly bean begins with a process called starch casting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;11;Dry corn starch is a fine white powder that retains impressions or shapes well,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;12;A machine called a mogul deposits a layer of corn starch in a plastic tray and moves the tray to a machine die which presses dents into the corn starch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;13;Each tray may contain several hundred to over 1200 of these impressions or dents each of which is the size and shape of the center of a jelly bean,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;14;The mogul moves the trays to a depositor or filling station where heated candy syrup is squirted into the tiny molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;15;From the mogul conveyors carefully move the trays to cooling rooms in which temperature and humidity are controlled and where the liquid candy cools and sets up to form the gummy center of the jelly bean,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;16;The panning process gives the jelly beans their outer color and flavor protective sugar shells and shiny glaze,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;17;The trays of candy centers are dumped out,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;18;The corn starch absorbs moisture from them during the cooling process but it is removed dried reprocessed and recycled to create molds for more candies,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;19;The centers which are all the same flavor and color are placed in stainless steel vessels called pans that are globeshaped and hollow with an opening at one pole of the globe,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;20;Just like globes the pans are tilted on their axes so the candies can be placed in them easily and so workers can add other ingredients through the openings,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;21;At the bottom pole or axis end the vessel is linked to a rotating power source,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;22;The pans rotate the jelly bean centers several hundred times per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;23;Sugar is added through the opening which gradually builds up on the soft center to form a harder sugar shell,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;24;Workers add colors and flavors during the panning process by pouring beakers of syrup supplied by the candy kitchen through the opening in the vessel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;25;They can also observe the jelly bean shells as they form and become colored throughout the process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;26;The beans are essentially finished at this point but are rather dulllooking,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;27;To give them their glossy coats a glaze of confectioners sugar is added while the beans are still revolving in the pans,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;28;The process of making the jelly bean takes 6 to 10 days depending on the kind of bean and the manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;29;Packaging is the final step before sending the jelly beans to distributors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;30;Jelly beans are placed in trays after panning and are still segregated by color or flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;31;The trays of candies are taken to a large bin where they are dumped in and mixed to the desired combination of colors and flavors,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;32;The mixing bin is a large rotating cylinder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;33;On one side a grid is set in the wall of the bin,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;34;Beans that are too small fall through the openings in the grid and into a receiving bin while beans that are too large stick in the mesh and are removed later,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;35;The beans that continue rotating are therefore only the desired size and shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;36;They fall from the mixing bin onto a conveyor where workers inspect them and remove any candies that look imperfect,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;37;The beans that pass inspection move on the conveyor to a packaging machine where the candy is weighed and bagged in any of several sizes of bags either for bulk sale or purchase by individual consumers,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;38;The packaging machine can package and seal about 80000 bags of jelly beans a day,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;39;Exceptions to the sorting and mixing process occur when jelly beans (usually the gourmet type) are packaged by single flavor or when the flavors are separated in small compartments in gift or sampler boxes that let the taster experience the unique flavors of designer beans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;40;The candies are still sized and inspected but individual flavors are then placed in funnellike bins,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;41;The small openings fit the compartments in plastic trays in the gift boxes and a controlled quantity of each flavor is dropped into its specific tray compartment,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;42;Although the candies are thoroughly mixed to try to get an equal distribution of colors the randomness of conveying and sorting may cause some variations in the mix,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;43;The consumer who purchases the larger bag has a better chance statistically of getting a nearequal distribution of colors and flavors,Relevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;44;Slight variations in size and shape account for one bag of jelly beans containing more beans than the next even though the contents are weighed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Jelly Bean;45;Some manufacturers put more than the stated weight in each package so the customer may actually get more beans than paid for in each bag,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;1;The body of a polyethylene kayak is a long hollow shell of uniform thickness made by a process called rotational molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Kayak;2;After the shell is made the seat and other components are added in a manual assembly process,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;3;The shell may be molded in one piece or it may be made from two separate pieces which are joined later,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;4;Rotational molding requires fairly rounded contours so onepiece shells cannot have sharp intersections between surfaces,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Kayak;5;If the design requires a sharper intersection—such as between the hull and the deck for example—then a twopiece shell is used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Kayak;6;The process for making the twopiece shell is described here,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Kayak;7;Measured amounts of powdered or granulated polyethylene plastic are mixed with coloring agents and an exact amount is loaded into the bottom of a twopiece thinwalled aluminum mold for either the hull or the deck,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;8;The mold is then closed and the two halves secured tightly,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;9;The mold is held by a mechanical arm which can rotate the mold in two directions at the same time,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;10;The arm can also move or index the mold from one process station to another,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;11;After the mold is loaded it is moved to the heating station where an oven heats it to 480840°F (250450°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;12;As the heat from the mold melts the plastic the mold is slowly rotated in two directions,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;13;Gravitational force causes the melted plastic to flow to the front and rear and up the sides of the rotating mold eventually covering the entire surface with a uniformly thick skin of plastic,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;14;Continued heating then fuses the plastic into a solid layer that attaches itself to the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;15;Next the mold is indexed to the cooling chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Kayak;16;By continuing to rotate the mold and gradually cooling it with carefully directed sprays of air and then water the kayak hull or deck further hardens and shrinks away from the mold,Relevant

MadeHow;Lead ;1;The first step in retrieving leadbearing ore is to mine it underground,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;2;Workers using heavy machinery drill the rock from deep tunnels with heavy machinery or blast it with dynamite leaving the ore in pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;3;Then they shovel the ore onto loaders and trucks and haul it to a shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;4;The shaft at a large mine may be a mile or more from the drill or blast site,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;5;The miners dump the ore down the shaft and from there it is hoisted to the surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;6;After the ore is removed from the mine it is treated at a concentrating mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;7;Concentrating means to remove the waste rock from the lead,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;8;To begin the ore must be crushed into very small pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;9;The ore is ground at the mill leaving it in particles with diameters of 01 millimeter or less,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;10;This means the individual granules are finer than table salt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;11;The texture is something like granulated sugar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;12;The principal lead ore galena is properly known as lead sulfide and sulfur makes up a substantial portion of the mineral,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;13;The flotation process collects the sulfurbearing portions of the ore which also contains the valuable metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;14;First the finely crushed ore is diluted with water and then poured into a tank called a flotation cell,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;15;The ground ore and water mixture is called slurry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;16;One percent pine oil or a similar chemical is then added to the slurry in the tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;17;The tank then agitates shaking the mixture violently,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;18;The pine oil attracts the sulfide particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;19;Then air is bubbled through the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;20;This causes the sulfide particles to form an oily froth at the top of the tank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;21;The waste rock which is called gangue sinks to the bottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;22;The flotation process is controlled by means of Xray analyzers,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;23;A flotation monitor in the control room can check the metal content of the slurry using the Xray analysis,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;24;Then with the aid of a computer the monitor may adjust the proportion of the chemical additive to optimize recovery of the metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;25;Other chemicals are also added to the flotation cell to help concentrate the minerals,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;26;Alum and lime aggregate the metal or make the particles larger,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;27;Xanthate is also added to the slurry in order to help the metal particles float to the surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;28;At the end of the flotation process the lead has been separated from the rock and other minerals too such as zinc and copper have been separated out,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;29;After the ore is concentrated in the flotation cells it flows to a filter which removes up to 90 of the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;30;The concentrate at this point contains from 4080 lead with large amounts of other impurities mostly sulfur and zinc,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;31;It is ready at this stage to be shipped to the smelter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;32;The gangue or rock that was not mineralbearing must be pumped out of the flotation tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;33;It may be dumped into a pond resembling a natural lake and when the pond eventually fills the land can be replanted,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;34;The lead concentrate fresh from the filter needs to be further refined to remove the sulfur,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;35;After the concentrate is unloaded at what is called the sinter plant it is mixed with other leadbearing materials and with sand and limestone,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;36;Then the mixture is spread on a moving grate,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;37;Air which has been heated to 2550°F (1400°C) blows through the grate,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;38;Coke is added as fuel and the sulfur in the ore concentrate combusts to sulfur dioxide gas,Relevant

MadeHow;Lead ;40;It is captured at a separate acid plant and converted to sulfuric acid which has many uses,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;41;After the ore has been roasted in this way it fuses into a brittle material called sinter,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;42;The sinter is mostly lead oxide but it can also contain oxides of zinc iron and silicon some lime and sulfur,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;43;As the sinter passes off the moving grate it is broken into lumps,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;44;The lumps are then loaded into the blast furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;45;The sinter falls into the top of the blast furnace along with coke fuel,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;46;A blast of air comes through the lower part of the furnace combusting the coke,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;47;The burning coke generates a temperature of about 2200°F (1200°C) and produces carbon monoxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;48;The carbon monoxide reacts with the lead and other metal oxides producing molten lead nonmetallic waste slag and carbon dioxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;49;Then the molten metal is drawn off into drossing kettles or molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;50;The molten lead as it comes from the blast furnace is from 9599 pure,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;51;It is called at this point base bullion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;52;It must be further refined to remove impurities because commercial lead must be from 9999999 pure,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;53;To refine the bullion it is kept in the drossing kettle at a temperature just above its melting point about 626°F (330°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;54;At this temperature any copper left in the bullion rises to the top of the kettle and forms a scum or dross which can be skimmed off,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;55;Gold and silver can be removed from the bullion by adding to it a small quantity of zinc,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;56;The gold and silver dissolves more easily in zinc than in lead and when the bullion is cooled slightly a zinc dross rises to the top bringing the other metals with it,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;57;When the lead has been sufficiently refined it is cooled and cast into blocks which may weigh as much as a ton,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;58;This is the finished product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lead ;59;Lead alloys may also be produced at the smelter plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;60;In this case metals are added to the molten lead in precise proportions to produce a lead material for specific industrial uses,Relevant
MadeHow;Lead ;61;For example the lead commonly used in car batteries and also for pipe sheet cable sheathing and ammunition is alloyed with antimony because this increases the metals strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;1;The skins are trimmed and sorted according to size weight and thickness,Relevant

MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;7;Finally the hides are pickled with salt and sulfuric acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;8;The hides undergo one of three types of tanning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;9;Vegetable tanning requires the most time with the skins soaked in progressively stronger tannic acid solutions for several weeks,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;10;However some soft leathers such as lambskin may be soaked for as little as 12 hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;11;Mineral tanning is significantly faster but can change the color of the leather,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;12;For this method the skins are placed in alum saltfilled drums fitted with paddles that provide a constant agitating motion,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;13;The third method oil tanning is the one that resembles the ancient methods most closely,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;14;Here fish oil is sprayed onto the skins,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;15;After the skins have been tanned they are washed once again and wrung out thoroughly,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;16;Then the skins are passed under a band knife which cuts the skins to a uniform thickness and placed on conveyer belts which carry them to drying tunnels,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;17;Usually the skins are stretched on frames to prevent shrinkage during the drying stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;18;To combat the stiffness that drying produces the hides are sprayed with water and soap and allowed to hang for a period of time,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;19;After the skins have been conditioned they are placed in machines designed to rhythmically manipulate the leather so that the fibers are further loosened and made more flexible,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;20;In the final drying period the hides are hung in vacuumdrying cabinets,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;21;When the skins are thoroughly dried they are buffed with revolving steel cylinders covered with abrasive paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;22;Suede finishes are produced by passing the hides under highspeed emery wheels,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;23;At this point glazes dyes and lacquers are applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 1;24;The skins are now ready to be sent to the garment factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;1;The development of highspeed sewing machinery changed the face of traditional sewing factories where one person may have worked on a single garment from start to finish,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;2;Because leather garments are considered luxury items handconstruction by highly skilled artisans is still sought by many consumers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;3;However the following steps are those used in factory mass production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;4;Garment manufacturers typically employ designers to create patterns from which the clothing is made,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;5;Computerized machines grade the designs according to government anthropometric tables which assign sizes based on body height and weight,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;6;The computer then produces patterns in a range of sizes from the original design,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;7;The tanned leather is placed on moving tables called spreaders,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;8;Although modern technology allows several layers of fabric to be cut simultaneously leather is usually cut one layer at a time,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;9;The pattern is placed on top of the leather,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;10;This is accomplished in one of two ways tissuepaper patterns may be pinned onto the leather or the pattern may be marked with tailors chalk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;11;The spreading table works on the conveyer system moving the fabric to the cutting machine which is fitted with either rotary blades or bandknives,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;12;The table is either guided by a human operator or run automatically,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;13;The most recent technological advance is the computerized laser beam system in which the fabric seams are vaporized rather than cut,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;14;Lining material for the jacket is cut in the same manner,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;15;Because it is of a much thinner weight lining can be placed on the spreaders in multiple layers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;16;The jacket is assembled in roughly this order the sides are stitched to the back portion sleeve underseams are stitched together and the sleeves are attached to the armholes,Relevant

MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;18;Patch pockets are sewn onto the side pieces before they are stitched to the back portion and side pockets are sewn in at the same time that the sides are attached to the back,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;19;Generally lining material is attached to each piece before it is sewn onto the jacket,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;20;In mass production the pieces are moved along a highly sophisticated production line using integrated automatic sewing machines that are capable of sewing as many as 8000 stitches per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;21;In a sequential system one sewing machine stitches a particular section of the jacket and then moves the garment to another sewing machine which performs the next step,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;22;For example after one machine stitches a cuff to the sleeve the sleeve moves to another machine where it is attached to the jacket armhole,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;23;A tandem sewing system calls for two or more machines to work on the same garment simultaneously,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;24;In this instance one machine attaches buttons to the front of the jacket while another machine applies the collar,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;25;Each step from setting thread and needle positions to aligning the fabric to extracting the sewed materials is preprogrammed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;26;Each sewing machine is equipped with underbed trimming devices that automatically knot and cut threads after each seam is sewn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;27;Excess threads are carried away to waste receptacles by streams of compressed air,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;28;Operators regulate the work at each station with a modified presserfoot or from a control panel,Relevant
MadeHow;Leather Jacket 2;29;A stopmotion device allows the operator to halt production to make adjustments such as replacing broken threads or needles,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Life Vest;3;As many as 100 life vests may be manufactured simultaneously in an automated manufacturing process such as the one described here,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;4;Pattern designs are digitally fed from a computer into a machine called a plotter which draws a stencil of the pattern design on long sheets of white paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;5;The drawn sheets are called markers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;6;A machine called a spreader unrolls a bolt of nylon fabric along a table usually 6672 inches (168183 cm) wide and up to 100 feet (31 m) long,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;7;Thin fabrics such as nylon may be layered 25 deep for cutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;8;Wrinkles are smoothed by the spreader or by hand and the marker is laid on top of the nylon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;9;Some manufacturers use an automated cutting machine to cut the pattern pieces out of the nylon,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;10;Other manufacturers may cut the pieces by hand using a portable motordriven straight knife which resembles a jig saw,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;11;In automated cutting the digital pattern is fed into the cutting machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;12;A sheet of cellophane wider than the fabric is drawn over the top of the marker and fabric layers,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;13;A vacuum pulls the cellophane down tight against the table holding the marker and nylon layers in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;14;A knife cuts the pattern out of cellophane marker and fabric layers at the same time,Relevant

MadeHow;Life Vest;16;The marker which can be read through the cellophane identifies the pattern pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;17;The closedcell foam is sliced to the desired thickness with a type of band saw called a splitter,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;18;A band saw has a long thin blade welded in a continuous loop that travels over a driven wheel up and over one or more idler wheels and then down through the material being cut,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;19;The foam then goes through the pattern cutting process in the same way as the nylon,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;20;Reflective tape and small attachable pieces such as straps are cut from rolls with a smaller cutting machine called a die cutter,Relevant
MadeHow;Life Vest;21;Sewing professionals each stationed at an industrial sewing machine match the pieces and sew them together,Relevant

MadeHow;Magnet;1;Just as the materials are different for different kinds of magnets the manufacturing processes are also different,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnet;2;Many electromagnets are cast using standard metal casting techniques,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnet;3;Flexible permanent magnets are formed in a plastic extrusion process in which the materials are mixed heated and forced through a shaped opening under pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;4;Some magnets are formed using a modified powdered metallurgy process in which finely powdered metal is subjected to pressure heat and magnetic forces to form the final magnet,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;5;Here is a typical powdered metallurgy process used to produce powerful neodymiumironboron permanent magnets with crosssectional areas of about 310 square inches (2065 sq cm) 1 The appropriate amounts of neodymium iron and boron are heated to melting in a vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;6;The vacuum prevents any chemical reaction between air and the melting materials that might contaminate the final metal alloy,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;7;Once the metal has cooled and solidified it is broken up and crushed into small pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;8;The small pieces are then ground into a fine powder in a ball mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;9;The powdered metal is placed in a mold called a die that is the same length and width (or diameter for round magnets) as the finished magnet,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;10;A magnetic force is applied to the powdered material to line up the powder particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;11;While the magnetic force is being applied the powder is pressed from the top and bottom with hydraulic or mechanical rams to compress it to within about 0125 inches (032 cm) of its final intended thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;12;Typical pressures are about 10000 psi to 15000 psi (70 MPa to 100 MPa),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnet;13;Some shapes are made by placing the powdered material in a flexible airtight evacuated container and pressing it into shape with liquid or gas pressure,Relevant

MadeHow;Magnet;15;The compressed slug of powdered metal is removed from the die and placed in an oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;16;The process of heating compressed powdered metals to transform them into fused solid metal pieces is called sintering,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnet;17;The process usually consists of three stages,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnet;18;In the first stage the compressed material is heated at a low temperature to slowly drive off any moisture or other contaminants that may have become entrapped during the pressing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;19;In the second stage the temperature is raised to about 7090 of the melting point of the metal alloy and held there for a period of several hours or several days to allow the small particles to fuse together,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;20;Finally the material is cooled down slowly in controlled stepbystep temperature increments,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnet;21;The sintered material then undergoes a second controlled heating and cooling process known as annealing,Relevant

MadeHow;Milking ;27;Workers wield an assortment of hand polishers and attachments to shine all contact and protective surfaces from the claws to receivers to pipelines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Milking ;28;These drivers of air and fluids through the system are manufactured by select vendors,Relevant
MadeHow;Milking ;29;The unit is basically a sealed iron case with a set of timing gears inside and an impeller resembling two blades or paddles on a shaft that spins at over 3000 revolutions per minute to create a vacuum that will draw fluids in the line,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Milking ;30;The making of the pumps requires raw castings to be poured for the various parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Milking ;31;The rough parts are handmachined on a bench by technicians and then placed on a CNC rotating cutter table where the cutting stone makes two precise passes along the predetermined edges to cut away any rough surfaces,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Milking ;32;The assembly of the major components—along with seals bearings and shafts—is critical because a variation of just 0002 inch can change the balance and affect the pump,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Nail;3;The nails may then be further twisted or formed cleaned finished and packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;4;Wire is drawn from a coil and fed into the nailmaking machine where it is gripped by a pair of gripper dies,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;5;The shape of the head of the nail has been machined into the end of the dies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail;6;While the dies clamp the wire in place the free end of the wire is struck by a mechanical hammer,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;7;This deforms the end of the wire into the die cavity to form the head of the nail,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;8;With the wire still clamped in the dies a set of shaped cutters strike the opposite end of the nail forming the point and cutting the nail free from the rest of the wire coming off the coil,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;9;The dies open and an expelling mechanism knocks the nail into a collection pan below the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;10;The free end of the wire is drawn from the coil and fed into the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;11;The cycle then begins again,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail;12;Nails with helical twists serrations or other surface configurations are fed into other machines that roll twist stamp or cut the required forms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail;13;This may be a purely mechanical process or may require heating the material before forming,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nail;14;The nails are cleaned in a rotating barrel filled with hot caustic soda,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;15;This removes any oil from the forming machine and cleans up any small metal scraps or nippings that might be clinging to the nails,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;16;Many nails are given a final bright finish before being packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Nail;17;This is accomplished by placing the nails in a rotating drum of hot sawdust to lightly polish the surface of the nails,Relevant

MadeHow;Neon Sign ;1;Manufacturing neon signs is largely a manual process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;2;It consists of bending the tubing and attaching the electrodes removing any impurities from within the tubing then evacuating the air and adding the gas,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;3;The following process is typical,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;4;Lengths of glass tubing are cleaned and placed vertically in a coating machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;5;The machine blows a liquid phosphor suspension upwards into the tube and then lets it drain back out the bottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;6;The tubes are placed vertically in an oven which dries the coating,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;7;Color tints are applied in a similar manner,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;8;Tubes that are to be filled with neon to form a red or orange light or argon to form a blue light are left clear,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;9;The design of the sign is laid out in full size on a heatresistant sheet of asbestos,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;10;The glass tubing is carefully heated and softened using a variety of burners,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;11;Gasfired ribbon burners 24 inches (61 cm) or longer are used to make curves in round letters and the sweeping curves of script,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;12;Smaller hand torches are used to heat shorter lengths,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;13;Using the asbestos template as a guide the tubing is bent by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;14;The tube benders do not wear protective gloves because they must be able to feel the heat transfer and the degree of softening in the glass to determine the right moment to make the bend,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;15;To prevent the softened tubing from collapsing the tube bender attaches a short length of flexible hose called a blow hose to one end,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;16;While the glass is still soft the tube bender gently blows into the hose to force the tubing back to its original diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;17;Tubes with restricted diameters will not operate properly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;18;Most large neon signs are made of several sections of glass tubing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;19;A length of 810 feet (2442591 m) for each section is considered a practical limit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;20;To make each section the ends of two lengths of tubing are heated and spliced together,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;21;When the shape of the lettering or design has been formed for a section an electrode is heated and fused onto each end,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;22;A small port called a tubulation is added to allow the tubing to be evacuated with a vacuum pump,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;23;This tubulation port may be part of one of the electrodes or may be a separate piece joined into the tubing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;24;A process known as bombarding is used to remove any impurities from the glass phosphors and electrodes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;25;First the air inside the tubing is evacuated,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;26;After the vacuum reaches a certain level dry air is allowed back into the tubing until the pressure is in the range of 002004 inches (0442010 mm) of mercury,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;27;The longer the tubing the lower the pressure may have to be,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;28;A very highcurrent transformer is connected to the electrodes,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;29;For a length of tubing that may normally run on 30 milliamperes 400750 milliamperes may used for the bombarding process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;30;The high current heats the glass to about 420°F (216°C) and the metal electrode is heated to about 1400°F (760°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;31;This heating forces the impurities out of the materials and the vacuum pump carries the impurities out of the system,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;32;Once the tube has cooled the gas is inserted under low pressure,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;33;The gas must be free from impurities in order for the sign to operate properly and have a long life,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;34;The normal fill pressure for a tube 06 inches (15 mm) in diameter is about 05 inches (12 mm) of mercury,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;35;The tubulation port is then heated and sealed off,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;36;The finished gasfilled tubing is put through an aging process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;37;Sometimes this process is referred to as burning in the tube,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;38;The purpose is to allow the gas in the tube to stabilize and operate properly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;39;A transformer often rated slightly higher than the normal operating current is attached to the electrodes,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;40;The tube should come to full illumination within 15 minutes if neon is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;41;It may take up to a few hours for argon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;42;If a small amount of mercury is to be added to an argon tube a droplet was first placed into the tubulation port before it was sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;43;The droplet is then rolled from one end to the other to coat the electrodes after the aging process,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;44;Any problems such as a flicker in the gas or a hot spot on the tube indicate the tubing must be opened and the bombarding and filling processes repeated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;45;Small neon signs are mounted on their framework and wired in the shop,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;46;Larger signs may be mounted in pieces and put into place on the building or other support structure where they are interconnected and wired,Relevant
MadeHow;Neon Sign ;47;Very large installations may require months to install,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;1;The composing room receives the story in an electronic format with the computer text file already translated with typeset codes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;2;In a typeset file the characters are of the same type—style size and width—as they appear on the pages of the newspaper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;3;The setting of stories into the type that a reader sees went unchanged for several decades until the latter years of the 20th century,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;4;Well into the 1800s type was set by hand letter by letter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;5;A typesetter dropped small metal letters into a handheld tray called a stick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;6;The invention of the Linotype machine in 1884 made possible a quicker more efficient method of typesetting ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;7;Invented by German immigrant Ottmar Mergenthaler of Baltimore Maryland this large cumbersome machine worked by casting hot lead into a line of type with the assistance of an operator who typed in the copy on a keyboard ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;8;Individual lines of type were then placed by hand onto a page form ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;9;When a page was completed it was then sent to a stereotyping room where a curved metal plate was made from the page form ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;10;The page form was then placed on the printing press ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;11;Modern technology has replaced the Linotype process through a method called phototypesetting ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;12;The first step in this process is the transfer of the dummy to the page layout section of the newspaper ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;13;There an operator transfers the instructions on the dummy into a rough page prototype ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;14;A printed version may be looked over and adjusted several times by one of the reporters whose story is featured as well as by the copy editor ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;15;If another breaking story comes in this page layout can be altered in a matter of minutes ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;16;The final version of the page is then approved by the editor on duty—sometimes a night editor in the case of a paper that is slated for a morning edition—and sent over to a process department ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;17;There the page is taken in its computer format and transferred via laser beams onto film in an image setter apparatus ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;18;The operator then takes the film to a processor in another section of the paper who develops it and adjusts it for its final look ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;19;Photographs are scanned into another computer terminal and inserted into the page layout ,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;20;The pages that are set to be printed together are then taped down onto a device called a stripper and an editor checks them over once more for errors,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;21;The strippers are then put into frames on lightsensitive film and the image of each page is burned onto the film,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;22;The film of each page is inserted into a laser reader a large facsimile machine that scans the page and digitally transfers the images to the printing center of the newspaper,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;23;At the printing center typically a large plant separate from the newspapers editorial offices and centrally located to facilitate citywide distribution the pages arrive at the laser room and are put through a laser writer another scanning device that makes a negative image of them,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;24;In the negative image of the page the text is white while the blank spaces are black,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;25;The final images of each page are further adjusted,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;26;This lastminute adjustment may involve finetuning of the colored sections and retouching photographs,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;27;From these negatives the forms from which the paper will be printed are composed in a platemaking room,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;28;The film of the page usually done two pages at a time is then placed on a lighted box,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;29;Next an aluminum plate containing a lightsensitive coating is placed on top of the image of the pages,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;30;The light box is then switched on and ultraviolet light develops the image of the pages onto the aluminum plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;31;The aluminum plate is then bent at the edges so that it will fit into a press and is fitted onto plate cylinders,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;32;The aluminum plates of each page next move on to the actual printing press an enormous machine often two stories high,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;33;When the press is running the noise in the building is deafening and employees must wear earplugs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;34;The most common method of printing newspapers is called web offset,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;35;The web refers to the large sheets of blank newsprint that are inserted in rolls sometimes weighing over a ton into the actual printing press,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;36;The reels of newsprint are loaded in at the bottom floor of the press,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;37;The rolls are inserted onto a reel stand which has three components the first reel brings a roll of paper up to the press a second is loaded and ready to replace the first roll when it runs out and a third reel stays empty and ready to be fed with another when the first reel is almost finished,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;38;Each roll of blank newsprint has doublesided tape at its edges so that when one roll runs out in the press another smoothly takes up where the other left off without interrupting the printing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;39;The plate cylinders then press the image of the page onto a blanket cylinder leaving a version of the pages image on the cylinders soft material,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;40;When the paper runs through the press the blanket cylinder presses the image onto it,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;41;The chemical reaction of the ink which contains oil and the squirting of jets of water into the process result in the actual newspaper page of black or colored images on a white background,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;42;Since oil and water do not mix the areas where ink should adhere to the page are black or colored and water washes away the parts where ink is not needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;43;This is why this printing process is referred to as offset,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;44;Next the large sheets of printed newsprint move on to another large piece of machinery called a folder,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;45;There the pages are cut individually and folded in order,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;46;This entire printing process can move as fast as 60000 copies per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;47;Quality control technicians and supervisors take random copies and scan them for printing malfunctions in color order and readability,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;48;Next a conveyer belt moves the papers into a mail room section of the plant where they are stacked into quires or bundles of 24,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;49;The quires then move to another section where a machine wraps them in plastic,Relevant
MadeHow;Newspaper;50;The bundles are now ready to be loaded onto delivery trucks for distribution,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;1;The following paddle manufacturing process is an assembly line operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;2;It can be used to manufacture several types of paddles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;3;It combines custommade pieces alterations to stock materials and assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;4;Blades and grips are formed using a standard manufacturing process called injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;5;Materials needed in this process are granulated or powdered thermoplastics and color pigment which are mixed together,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;6;Injection molding is a process in which the raw materials are funneled through a hopper at the top of the injection molding machine into a heated barrel that mixes and softens them,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;7;The softened material is then forced or injected through the barrel by a retractable screw or plunger into a relatively cool mold cavity for hardening,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;8;In paddle manufacturing the mold cavity is shaped like the blade or grip,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;9;Once the blade or grip is fully cured the detachable mold cavity is opened thereby releasing the molded plastic piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;10;The injection molding process can operate continuously since the screw can retract to fill the barrel with fresh raw materials while the piece in the cavity hardens,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;11;Blades and grips must be inspected for flash,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;12;Flash is excess plastic that seeped into the seams of the mold cavity and hardened,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;13;Blades and grips are cleaned by hand to remove the excess plastic and smooth the edges,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;14;Aluminum tubing is cut to length using a table saw,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;15;The plastic tubing or other protective material used to cover the shaft is also cut by this method,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;16;Once the shafts are cut to size the cork or foam can be press fit into the shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;17;A press fit is the name for a method of attaching pieces together using the tightness of the bond that results from forcing the two pieces together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;18;Excess cork or foam is trimmed by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;19;The exact order of assembly can vary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;20;In a typical operation plastic tubing or other protective material is slipped over the aluminum shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;21;The plastic tubing is heated with a hot air gun which causes it to shrink tightly onto the shaft,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;22;In some assembly operations the grip is pushed onto the aluminum shaft before the plastic tubing,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;23;In this case the plastic tubing shrinks over the neck of the grip therefore securing the grip to the shaft as well,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;24;The neck of the blade is press fit on to the plastic covered shaft at the paddles throat,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;25;This helps prevent the blade from becoming loose and spinning on the shaft,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paddle;26;In another variation the grips and blades are shaped so that they are pushed inside the ends of the plastic covered aluminum tubing by machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;27;Hydraulic or pneumatic presses squeeze and slightly deform the ends of the aluminum tubing into the neck of the blade or grip to securely fasten the plastic pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;28;Once the paddle is fully assembled it is wrapped in a clear plastic bag,Relevant
MadeHow;Paddle;29;The paddles are then packed in corrugated boxes about 30 to a box for shipping to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;1;Several processes are commonly used to convert logs to wood pulp,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;2;In the mechanical process logs are first tumbled in drums to remove the bark,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;3;The logs are then sent to grinders which break the wood down into pulp by pressing it between huge revolving slabs,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;4;The pulp is filtered to remove foreign objects,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;5;In the chemical process wood chips from debarked logs are cooked in a chemical solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;6;This is done in huge vats called digesters,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;7;The chips are fed into the digester and then boiled at high pressure in a solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;8;The chips dissolve into pulp in the solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;9;Next the pulp is sent through filters,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;10;Bleach may be added at this stage or colorings,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;11;The pulp is sent to the paper plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;12;The pulp is next put through a pounding and squeezing process called appropriately enough beating,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;13;Inside a large tub the pulp is subjected to the effect of machine beaters,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;14;At this point various filler materials can be added such as chalks clays or chemicals such as titanium oxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;15;These additives will influence the opacity and other qualities of the final product,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;16;Sizings are also added at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;17;Sizing affects the way the paper will react with various inks,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;18;Without any sizing at all a paper will be too absorbent for most uses except as a desk blotter,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;19;A sizing such as starch makes the paper resistant to waterbased ink (inks actually sit on top of a sheet of paper rather than sinking in),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;20;A variety of sizings generally rosins and gums is available depending on the eventual use of the paper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;21;Paper that will receive a printed design such as gift wrapping requires a particular formula of sizing that will make the paper accept the printing properly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;22;In order to finally turn the pulp into paper the pulp is fed or pumped into giant automated machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;23;One common type is called the Fourdrinier machine which was invented in England in 1807,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;24;Pulp is fed into the Fourdrinier machine on a moving belt of fine mesh screening,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;25;The pulp is squeezed through a series of rollers while suction devices below the belt drain off water,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;26;If the paper is to receive a watermark a device called a dandy moves across the sheet of pulp and presses a design into it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;27;The paper then moves onto the press section of the machine where it is pressed between rollers of wool felt,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;28;The paper then passes over a series of steamheated cylinders to remove the remaining water,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;29;A large machine may have from 40 to 70 drying cylinders,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;30;Finally the dried paper is wound onto large reels where it will be further processed depending on its ultimate use,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;31;Paper is smoothed and compacted further by passing through metal rollers called calendars,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;32;A particular finish whether soft and dull or hard and shiny can be imparted by the calendars,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper;33;The paper may be further finished by passing through a vat of sizing material,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;34;It may also receive a coating which is either brushed on or rolled on,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;35;Coating adds chemicals or pigments to the papers surface supplementing the sizings and fillers from earlier in the process,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;36;Fine clay is often used as a coating,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;37;The paper may next be supercalendered that is run through extremely smooth calendar rollers for a final time,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper;38;Then the paper is cut to the desired size,Relevant

MadeHow;Pasta;6;If pasta is to be a flavored variety vegetable juices are added here,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;7;A tomato or beet mixture is added for red pasta spinach for green pasta carrots for orange pasta,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;8;Herbs and spices can also be folded in for additional flavoring,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;9;The mixture moves to a laminator where it is pressed into sheets by large cylinders,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;10;A vacuum mixermachine further flattens the dough while pressing air bubbles and excess water from the dough to reach the optimum water content of 12,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pasta;11;The roll of dough moves through a steamer which heats the dough to 220°F (104°C) in order to kill any existing bacteria,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;12;Depending on the type of noodle to be produced the dough is either cut or pushed through dies,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;13;Ribbon and stringstyle pasta—such as fettucine linguine spaghetti and capellini (angel hair)—are cut by rotating blades,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;14;To make tube or shellshaped pasta such as rigatoni ziti elbow macaroni and fusilli the dough is fed into an extruder which then pushes it through metal dies,Relevant
MadeHow;Pasta;15;The size and shape of the holes in the die determine the type of pasta,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pasta;16;To make vermicelli and capellini the pasta dough is pushed through holes between 0805 mm in diameter,Relevant

MadeHow;Salt;5;Then a machine that looks like a gigantic chain saw is used to cut a slot about 60 inches (15 cm) high about 66 feet (20 m) wide and about 10 feet (3 m) deep into the salt at floor level,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;6;This process is known as undercutting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;7;A series of holes are drilled into the undercut salt with an electric drill containing a tungsten carbide bit,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;8;These holes are filled with an explosive such as dynamite or ammonium nitrate,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;9;Electric blasting caps connected to long wires are attached and the explosive is detonated from a safe distance,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;10;Cutting and blasting are repeated in a pattern that leaves pillars of salt standing to support the roof of the mining area,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;11;This is known as the roomandpillar method and is also used in coal mines,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;12;Chunks of blasted rock salt are transported to an underground crushing area,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;13;Here they are passed over a grating known as a grizzly which collects pieces smaller than about 9 inches (23 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;14;Larger pieces are crushed in a rotating cylinder between metal jaws with spiked teeth,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;15;The salt is then transported outside the mine to a secondary crushing area where a smaller grizzly and a smaller crusher reduce the particle size to about 32 inches (8 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;16;At this point foreign matter is removed from the salt a process known as picking,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;17;Metal is removed by magnets and other material by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;18;Rocky material may also be removed in a Bradford breaker a rotating metal drum with small holes in the bottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;19;Salt is dumped into the drum breaks when it hits the bottom and passes through the holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;20;Rocky matter is generally harder than salt so it does not break and does not go through,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;21;The picked salt then goes to a tertiary crushing area where an even smaller grizzly and crusher produce particles about 10 inch (25 cm) in size,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;22;If smaller particles are needed the salt is passed through a grinder consisting of two metal cylinders rolling against each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;23;If purer salt is needed rock salt is dissolved in water to form brine for further processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;24;Otherwise the crushed or ground salt is passed through screens to sort it by size poured into bags and shipped to the consumer,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;25;The simplest method of evaporating brine is solar evaporation but it can only be used in hot dry sunny places,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;26;The brine is collected into shallow ponds and allowed to evaporate in the sun,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;27;Insoluble impurities such as sand and clay and slightly soluble impurities such as calcium carbonate settle to the bottom as evaporation begins,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;28;The brine is pumped or moved by gravity flow to another pond where calcium sulfate settles out as evaporation continues,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;29;The remaining brine is moved to yet another pond where the salt settles out as evaporation proceeds,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;30;The brine is moved one more time before evaporation is complete to prevent highly soluble impurities such as magnesium chloride magnesium sulfate potassium chloride and magnesium bromide from settling out with the salt,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;31;These substances may be collected separately for commercial use,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;32;Rock salt is simply crystallized salt,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;33;It is the result of the evaporation of ancient oceans millions of years ago,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;34;Large deposits of rock salt are found in the United States Canada Germany eastern Europe and China,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;35;The salt is scooped up by machines running on temporary railroad tracks laid on top of the layer of salt,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;36;It is then washed with highly concentrated salt water,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;37;This water contains so much salt that it cannot hold any more so the salt is washed free of any trace impurities without dissolving,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;38;The washed salt is removed from the salt water rinsed with a small amount of fresh water and piled into huge stacks to drain for two or three months,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;39;At this point the salt is about 994 pure and can be used for many industrial purposes,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;40;If purer salt is needed it is rewashed in salt water and fresh water allowed to drain for one or two days then dried in a hot air oven at about 365°F (185°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;41;This salt is about 998 pure and can be used for food processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;42;Most brine is processed by a multipleeffect vacuum evaporator,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;43;This device consists of three or more closed metal cylinders with conical bottoms,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;44;Brine is first treated chemically to remove calcium and magnesium compounds,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;45;It then fills the bottom of the cylinders,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;46;The brine in the first cylinder passes through tubes heated by steam,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;47;The brine boils and its steam enters the next cylinder where it heats the brine there,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;48;The steam from this brine heats the brine in the next cylinder and so on,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;49;In each cylinder the condensation of steam causes the pressure inside to drop allowing the brine to boil at a lower temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;50;Salt is removed from the bottom of the cylinders as a thick slurry,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;51;It is filtered to remove excess brine dried and passed through screens to sort the particles by size,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;52;Salt made this way is known as vacuum pan salt and consists of small cubic crystals,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;53;Brine is water containing a high concentration of salt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;54;The most obvious source of brine is the ocean but it can also be obtained from salty lakes and underground pools of salt water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;55;Brine may also be processed in a grainer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;56;The brine is chemically purified and pumped into a long open pan heated by steam running through pipes immersed in the brine,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;57;The brine is heated to a temperature slightly below the boiling point and flakes of salt form on its surface as it evaporates,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;58;Usually a temperature of about 194°F (90°C) is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;59;Lower temperatures produce larger flakes and higher temperatures produce smaller flakes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;60;The flakes grow until they sink to the bottom of the pan where they are collected and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;61;Grainer salt consists of small flakes rather than cubes and is preferred for certain uses in food processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;62;Sometimes the Alberger process is used in which the brine is first partially evaporated in a vacuum evaporator then moved to a grainer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;63;This process produces a mixture of flakes and cubes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Salt;64;At this point salt used for most purposes is ready to be packaged in bags or boxes and shipped to consumers,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;65;To make iodized table salt however potassium iodide is added then magnesium carbonate calcium silicate calcium phosphate magnesium silicate or calcium carbonate is added to make it freeflowing,Relevant
MadeHow;Salt;66;The salt is then packaged and shipped to restaurants and grocery stores,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;1;The polymerbased adhesive is mixed and placed into the machine which applies the glue to the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;2;For preprinted pads the memo headings are printed onto large sheets of paper,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;3;The paper is placed into the machine and prepared to be fed through the priming device,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;4;As the paper passes through the machine continuous rollers prime the back side of the paper with a substrate,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;5;Next the polymer glue is applied on top of the substrate,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;6;As the paper passes from the glue application another device stacks the sheets of paper on top of each other to form large pads,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;7;Attached to the bottom of the pad is a piece of paper listing the company and brand names,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;8;The pads are cut into smaller square and rectangular pads in the standard sizes ranging from the smaller 15 by 20 inches (38 by 51 cm) to 85 by 11 (22 by 28 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;9;The pads are labeled with the product name and manufacturer and wrapped in plastic,Relevant
MadeHow;SelfAdhesive Note ;10;The pads are packaged together in bulk into larger boxes and shipped to distributors and wholesalers,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;1;Only the healthiest moths are used for breeding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;2;Their eggs are categorized graded and meticulously tested for infection,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;3;Unhealthy eggs are burned,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;4;The healthiest eggs may be placed in cold storage until they are ready to be hatched,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;5;Once the eggs are incubated they usually hatch within seven days,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;6;They emerge at a mere oneeighth of an inch (32 mm) long and must be maintained in a carefully controlled environment,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;7;Under normal conditions the eggs would hatch once a year in the spring when mulberry trees begin to leaf,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;8;But with the intervention of sericulturists breeding can occur as many as three times per year,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;9;The silkworms feed only on the leaves of the mulberry tree,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;10;The mulberry leaves are finely chopped and fed to the voracious silkworms every few hours for 20 to 35 days,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;11;During this period the wormns increase in size to about 35 inches (89 cm),Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;12;They also shed their skin or molt four times and change color from gray to a translucent pinkish color,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;13;When the silkworm starts to fidget and toss its head back and forth it is preparing to spin its cocoon,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;14;The caterpillar attaches itself to either a twig or rack for support,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;15;As the worm twists its head it spins a double strand of fiber in a figureeight pattern and constructs a symmetrical wall around itself,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;16;The filament is secreted from each of two glands called the spinneret located under the jaws of the silkworm,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;17;The insoluble proteinlike fiber is called fibroin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;18;The fibroin is held together by sericin a soluble gum secreted by the worm which hardens as soon as it is exposed to air,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;19;The result is the raw silk fiber called the bave,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;20;The caterpillar spins a cocoon encasing itself completely,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;21;It can then safely transform into the chrysalis which is the pupa stage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;22;The natural course would be for the chrysalis to break through the protective cocoon and emerge as a moth,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;23;However sericulturists must destroy the chrysalis so that it does not break the silk filament,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;24;This is done by stoving or stifling the chrysalis with heat,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;25;The filature is the factory in which the cocoons are processed into silk thread,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;26;In the filature the cocoons are sorted by various characteristics including color and size so that the finished product can be of uniform quality,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;27;The cocoons must then be soaked in hot water to loosen the sericin,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;28;Although the silk is about 20 sericin only 1 is removed at this stage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;29;This way the gum facilitates the following stage in which the filaments are combined to form silk thread or yarn,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;30;Reeling may be achieved manually or automatically,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;31;The cocoon is brushed to locate the end of the fiber,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;32;It is threaded through a porcelain eyelet and the fiber is reeled onto a wheel,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;33;Meanwhile diligent operators check for flaws in the filaments as they are being reeled,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;34;As each filament is nearly finished being reeled a new fiber is twisted onto it thereby forming one long continuous thread,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;35;Sericin contributes to the adhesion of the fibers to each other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;36;The end product the raw silk filaments are reeled into skeins,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;37;These skeins are packaged into bundles weighing 510 pounds (24 kg) called books,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;38;The books are further packaged into bales of 133 pounds (60 kg) and transported to manufacturing centers,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;39;Silk thread also called yarn is formed by throwing or twisting the reeled silk,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;40;First the skeins of raw silk are categorized by color size and quantity,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;41;Next they are soaked in warm water mixed with oil or soap to soften the sericin,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;42;The silk is then dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;43;As the silk filaments are reeled onto bobbins they are twisted in a particular manner to achieve a certain texture of yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;44;For instance singles consist of several filaments which are twisted together in one direction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;45;They are turned tightly for sheer fabrics and loosely for thicker fabrics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;46;Combinations of singles and untwisted fibers may be twisted together in certain patterns to achieve desired textures of fabrics such as crepe de chine voile or tram,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;47;Fibers may also be manufactured in different patterns for use in the nap of fabrics for the outside or for the inside of the fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;48;The silk yarn is put through rollers to make the width more uniform,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;49;The yarn is inspected weighed and packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;50;Finally the yarn is shipped to fabric manufacturers,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;51;To achieve the distinctive softness and shine of silk the remaining sericin must be removed from the yarn by soaking it in warm soapy water,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;52;Degumming decreases the weight of the yarn by as much as 25,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;53;After degumming the silk yarn is a creamy white color,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;54;It may next be dyed as yarn or after the yarn has been woven into fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;55;The silk industry makes a distinction between puredye silk and what is called weighted silk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;56;In the puredye process the silk is colored with dye and may be finished with watersoluble substances such as starch glue sugar or gelatin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;57;To produce weighted silk metallic substances are added to the fabric during the dying process,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;58;This is done to increase the weight lost during degumming and to add body to the fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;59;If weighting is not executed properly it can decrease the longevity of the fabric so puredye silk is considered the superior product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;60;After dyeing silk fabric may be finished by additional processes such as bleaching embossing steaming or stiffening,Relevant
MadeHow;Silk;61;Not all of the silk filament is usable for reeled silk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;62;The leftover silk may include the brushed ends or broken cocoons,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;63;This shorter staple silk may be used for spinning silk in a manner of fabrics like cotton and linen,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;64;The quality of spun silk is slightly inferior to reeled silk in that it is a bit weaker and it tends to become fuzzy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;65;The waste material from the spun silk can also be used for making waste silk or silk noil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Silk;66;This coarse material is commonly used for draperies and upholstery ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;1;Modern skis can be classified into three different types laminated torsionbox and singleshell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;2;The laminated method is the one most commonly used in ski manufacturing since the combination of various materials allows for greater array of models,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;3;Laminated skis may contain one or all of the following materials plastic fiberglass carbon wood steel aluminum neoprene or ceramics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;4;These elements are sandwiched or layered on the top and bottom of the core,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;5;In a torsionbox ski the core material is surrounded by fiberglass or carbon fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;6;Instead of being sandwiched around the core the layers wrap around it in what is known as wet wrap construction,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;7;The core is then sealed with resin and heat ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;8;This more complex manufacturing process means that torsionbox skis are more expensive than laminated ones but they provide better handling and thus are more appealing to serious skiers ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;9;Singleshell skis are made from a strong inner material such as wood but enclosed by a flexible fiberglass or plastic shell and sides ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;10;The lighter weight of singleshell skis means that more control is located at the tip of the skis giving the user better steering control and turning ability ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;11;The manufacturing process for most skis originates in a warehousetype room of the factory ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;12;Here all the raw materials—the roughlycut blocks of wood for wood cores the steel edges sheets of polyethylene for the bases rolls of fiberglass or aluminum—are sorted and stacked ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;13;For skis with wood cores the prelaminated wood is put through a mill for precise cutting and finishing ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;14;These mills are computeroperated by a technician who sets the parameters through numerical controls on the machine ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;15;This process is also used for aluminum cores ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;16;The machine cuts and mills the material including the cores thickness and sidecut and also collects the excess which are returned to the suppliers ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;17;In skis with polyurethane cores the top and base layers are put into a mold then a press and the foam is injected with a hose ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;18;As it expands and hardens the foam fuses the layers and becomes the core ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;19;Modern skis can be classified into three different types ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;20;In laminated skis various layers sandwich the core on top and bottom ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;21;In torsionbox ski construction the layers wrap around the core,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;22;In singleshell construction polyurethane foam is sometimes injected into the ski shell ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;23;As this foam expands and hardens the top and sides form one sheet ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;24;In the next step the core and the rest of the layers including the top and base are placed into a mold and then into a press ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;25;Heat and pressure result in a rudimentary ski then epoxy resin is used to completely seal the layers together ,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;26;Singleshell or cap skis require a more complicated assembly process and more precise molding chambers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;27;They still use wood or foam cores but the top and sides are united in one sheet and this makes the core less integral to the skis overall performance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;28;The polyethylene base the running surface of the ski is bonded onto the ski,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;29;Steel edges are also bonded onto the ski surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;30;Another important difference between the laminated and torsionbox types of skis and singleshell ones is the application of graphics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;31;Flashy colors and logos are a trademark of ski design and manufacturers use graphics to differentiate their models,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;32;In singleshell skis graphics are applied to the top or cap before the parts go into the mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;33;The heattransfer process is commonly used a method that can best be compared to the way an emblem is applied to a tshirt with an iron,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;34;In the ski industry this process is called sublimation and it yields a visually complex but clear image,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;35;Another method used in singleshell graphics applications is backprinting in which graphics are applied in reverse to a clear sheet through silkscreening then flipped over,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;36;During assembly the freshly applied graphics remain protected during the molding stage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;37;With traditional laminated and torsionbox skis the graphics are applied in one of the final steps of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;38;The actual ski goes through a silkscreen process where the design is first put on a piece of silk or other thin fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;39;The areas which are not to be colored are covered with an impermeable substance and then ink is forced through the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;40;This must be done several times over one press for each color and the ski must be allowed to dry between presses,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;41;A curtain coat of lacquer is then applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;42;Because of the complexities of this process skis made this way often take days to dry whereas singleshell skis can be finished in a matter of hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;43;The final finishing process is nearly the same among all types of skis,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;44;The bases must be put through a machine that grinds and polishes them and this is done with a combination of belt sanding and stone grinding,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;45;Stone grinding is considered superior to the belt method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Ski;46;Next the skis must be matched up into pairs,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;47;The edges are also beveled and polished,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;48;This is done with a machine that tests their flexibility and camber,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;49;After they are paired a quality control technician makes certain that they are wellmatched,Relevant
MadeHow;Ski;50;In the final stages the steel edges are oiled the skis waxed wrapped in polyethylene and boxed for shipping to retail outlets,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;1;The production of a smoke detector consists of two major steps,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;2;One is fabrication of the Am241 into a form (typically a foil) that can be installed into the sensing and reference chambers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;3;The other is assembly of the entire ICSD beginning either with all of the individual components or with prefabricated sensing and reference chambers obtained from the manufacturer of the radioactive source material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;4;The following description covers all steps even though some may be done by different manufacturers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;5;Tests and inspections at several stages of the assembly process ensure a reliable product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;6;The process begins with the compound AmO 2 an oxide of Am241,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;7;This substance is thoroughly mixed with gold shaped into a briquette and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470°F (800°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;8;A backing of silver and a front covering of gold or gold alloy are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;9;The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;10;The final thickness is about 0008 inches (02 mm) with the gold cover representing about one percent of the thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;11;The resulting foil strip which is about 08 inches (20 mm) wide is cut into sections 39 inches (1 meter) long,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;12;Circular ICSD source elements are punched out of the foil strip,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;13;Each disc which is about 02 inches (5 mm) in diameter is mounted in a metal holder,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;14;A thin metal rim on the holder is rolled over to completely seal the cut edge around the disc,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;15;One disc of source material is mounted in the sensing chamber and another is mounted in the adjacent reference chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;16;The electrodes are installed in both chambers and connected to external leads which project out of the bottoms of the chambers,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;17;Printed circuit boards are prepared from design schematics by punching holes for the component leads and by laying a copper trace on the back to form the paths for electric currents,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;18;On the assembly line the various electronic components (diodes capacitors resistors etc) are inserted into the proper holes on the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;19;Leads extending out the back of the board are trimmed,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;20;The sensing chamber reference chamber and an alarm horn are installed on the printed circuit board,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;21;The board then passes over a wave solder machine which solders the electronic components into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;22;The plastic housing consists of a mounting base and a cover,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;23;Both are made by injection molding process in which powdered plastic and molding pigments are mixed heated forced into a mold under pressure then cooled to form the final pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;24;The circuit board is seated on the plastic mounting base,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;25;A test button is installed so the device can be tested periodically after installation in the home,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;26;A mounting bracket is added to the base and the cover is added to complete the assembly,Relevant
MadeHow;Smoke Detector;27;The smoke detector is packaged in a cardboard box along with a battery and an owners manual,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;1;The kettle method of making soap is still used today by small soap manufacturing companies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;2;This process takes from four to eleven days to complete and the quality of each batch is inconsistent due to the variety of oils used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;3;Around 1940 engineers and scientists developed a more efficient manufacturing process called the continuous process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;4;This procedure is employed by large soap manufacturing companies all around the world today,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;5;Exactly as the name states in the continuous process soap is produced continuously rather than one batch at a time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;6;Technicians have more control of the production in the continuous process and the steps are much quicker than in the kettle method—it takes only about six hours to complete a batch of soap,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;7;Fats and alkali are melted in a kettle which is a steel tank that can stand three stories high and hold several thousand pounds of material,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;8;Steam coils within the kettle heat the batch and bring it to a boil,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;9;After boiling the mass thickens as the fat reacts with the alkali producing soap and glycerin,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;10;The soap and glycerin must now be separated,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;11;The mixture is treated with salt causing the soap to rise to the top and the glycerin to settle to the bottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;12;The glycerin is extracted from the bottom of the kettle,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;13;To remove the small amounts of fat that have not saponified a strong caustic solution is added to the kettle,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;14;This step in the process is called strong change,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;15;The mass is brought to a boil again and the last of the fat turns to soap The batch may be given another salt treatment at this time or the manufacturer may proceed to the next step 4 The next step is called pitching,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;16;The soap in the kettle is boiled again with added water The mass eventually separates into two layers The top layer is called neat soap which is about 70 soap and 30 water,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;17;The lower layer called nigre contains most of the impurities in the soap such as dirt and salt as well as most of the water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;18;The neat soap is taken off the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;19;The soap is then cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;20;The finishing process is the same as for soap made by the continuous process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;21;Developed around 1940 and used by todays major soapmaking companies the above illustrations show the continuous process of making soap,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;22;The first step of the continuous process splits natural fat into fatty acids and glycerin,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;23;The equipment used is a vertical stainless steel column with the diameter of a barrel called a hydrolizer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;24;It may be as tall as 80 feet (24 m),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;25;Pumps and meters attached to the column allow precise measurements and control of the process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;26;Molten fat is pumped into one end of the column while at the other end water at high temperature (266°F [130°C]) and pressure is introduced,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;27;This splits the fat into its two components,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;28;The fatty acid and glycerin are pumped out continuously as more fat and water enter,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;29;The fatty acids are then distilled for purification,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;30;The purified fatty acids are next mixed with a precise amount of alkali to form soap,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;31;Other ingredients such as abrasives and fragrance are also mixed in,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;32;The hot liquid soap may be then whipped to incorporate air,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;33;The soap may be poured into molds and allowed to harden into a large slab,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;34;It may also be cooled in a special freezer,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;35;The slab is cut into smaller pieces of bar size which are then stamped and wrapped,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;36;The entire continuous process from splitting to finishing can be accomplished in several hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;37;Most toiletry soap undergoes additional processing called milling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;38;The milled bar lathers up better and has a finer consistency than nonmilled soap,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;39;The cooled soap is fed through several sets of heavy rollers (mills) which crush and knead it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soap;40;Perfumes can best be incorporated at this time because their volatile oils do not evaporate in the cold mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;41;After the soap emerges from the mills it is pressed into a smooth cylinder and extruded,Relevant
MadeHow;Soap;42;The extruded soap is cut into bar size stamped and wrapped,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;1;Most soft drinks are made at local bottling and canning companies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;2;Brand name franchise companies grant licenses to bottlers to mix the soft drinks in strict accordance to their secret formulas and their required manufacturing procedures,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;3;The quality of water is crucial to the success of a soft drink,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;4;Impurities such as suspended particles organic matter and bacteria may degrade taste and color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;5;They are generally removed through the traditional process of a series of coagulation filtration and chlorination,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;6;Coagulation involves mixing a gelatinous precipitate or floc (ferric sulphate or aluminum sulphate) into the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;7;The floc absorbs suspended particles making them larger and more easily trapped by filters,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;8;During the clarification process alkalinity must be adjusted with an addition of lime to reach the desired pH level,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;9;The clarified water is poured through a sand filter to remove fine particles of floc,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;10;The water passes through a layer of sand and courser beds of gravel to capture the particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;11;Sterilization is necessary to destroy bacteria and organic compounds that might spoil the waters taste or color,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;12;The water is pumped into a storage tank and is dosed with a small amount of free chlorine,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;13;The chlorinated water remains in the storage tank for about two hours until the reaction is complete,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;14;Next an activated carbon filter dechlorinates the water and removes residual organic matter much like the sand filter,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;15;A vacuum pump deaerates the water before it passes into a dosing station,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;16;The dissolved sugar and flavor concentrates are pumped into the dosing station in a predetermined sequence according to their compatibility,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;17;The ingredients are conveyed into batch tanks where they are carefully mixed too much agitation can cause unwanted aeration,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;18;The syrup may be sterilized while in the tanks using ultraviolet radiation or flash pasteurization which involves quickly heating and cooling the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;19;Fruit based syrups generally must be pasteurized,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;20;The water and syrup are carefully combined by sophisticated machines called proportioners which regulate the flow rates and ratios of the liquids,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;21;The vessels are pressurized with carbon dioxide to prevent aeration of the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;22;Carbonation is generally added to the finished product though it may be mixed into the water at an earlier stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;23;The temperature of the liquid must be carefully controlled since carbon dioxide solubility increases as the liquid temperature decreases,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;24;Many carbonators are equipped with their own cooling systems,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;25;The amount of carbon dioxide pressure used depends on the type of soft drink,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;26;For instance fruit drinks require far less carbonation than mixer drinks such as tonics which are meant to be diluted with other liquids,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;27;The beverage is slightly overpressured with carbon dioxide to facilitate the movement into storage tanks and ultimately to the filler machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;28;The finished product is transferred into bottles or cans at extremely high flow rates,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;29;The containers are immediately sealed with pressureresistant closures either tinplate or steel crowns with corrugated edges twist offs or pull tabs,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;30;Because soft drinks are generally cooled during the manufacturing process they must be brought to room temperature before labeling to prevent condensation from ruining the labels,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;31;This is usually achieved by spraying the containers with warm water and drying them,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;32;Labels are then affixed to bottles to provide information about the brand ingredients shelf life and safe use of the product,Relevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;33;Most labels are made of paper though some are made of a plastic film,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;34;Cans are generally preprinted with product information before the filling stage,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Soft Drink;35;Finally containers are packed into cartons or trays which are then shipped in larger pallets or crates to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;1;Stained glass is still made the same way it was back in the Middle Ages and comes in various forms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;2;For the glass used in leaded glass windows a lump of the molten glass is caught up at one end of a blow pipe blown into a cylinder cut flattened and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;3;Artisans also vary this basic process in order to produce different effects,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;4;For example flashed glass is made by dipping a ball of molten white glass into molten colored glass which when blown and flattened results in a less intense color because it will be white on one side and colored on the other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;5;Socalled Norman slabs are made by blowing the molten glass into a mold in the shape of a foursided bottle,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;6;The sides are cut apart and form slabs thin at the edges and as much as 025 inch (06 cm) thik) at the center,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;7;Another form of glass known as cathedral glass is rolled into flat sheets,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;8;This results in a somewhat monotonous regularity of texture and thickness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;9;Other similarly made glasses are referred to as marine antique but have a more bubbly texture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;10;Large manufacturers of stained glass mix the batch of raw materials including alkaline fluxes and stabilizing agents in huge mixers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;11;The mix is then melted in a modern furnace at 2500°F (1371°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;12;Each ingredient must be carefully measured and weighed according to a calculated formula in order to produce the appropriate color,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;13;For cathedral glass the molten glass is ladled into a machine that rolls the glass into 18inch (32mm) thick sheets,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;14;The sheets are then cooled in a special furnace called an annealing lehr,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;15;The glass is then inspected trimmed to standard size and packed into cases,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;16;At a typical factory eight to ten different color runs are made per day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;17;Some manufacturers cut a small rectangle of glass from each run in order to provide a sample of each color to their customers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;18;There are hundreds of colors tints and patterns available as well as a number of different textures of cathedral glass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;19;Different textures are produced by changing the roller to one having the desired texture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;20;Glass manufacturers are continuously introducing new colors and types of glass to meet the demands of their customers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;21;Though some of the tools to make stained glass windows have been improved the windows are still hand crafted as they were centuries ago,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;22;The first step of the process involves the artist creating a small scale version of the final design,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;23;After the design has been approved the craftsperson takes measurements or templates of the actual window openings to create a pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;24;This pattern is usually drawn on paper or cardboard and is the actual size of the spaces to be filled with glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;25;Next a fullsized drawing called the cartoon is prepared in black and white,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;26;From the cartoon the cutline and pattern drawings are made,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;27;The modern cutline drawing is a careful exact tracing of the leadlines of the cartoon on heavy paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;28;The leadlines are the outlines of the shapes for patterns to which the glass is to be cut,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;29;This drawing serves as the guide for the subsequent placing and binding with lead of the many pieces of glass,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;30;The patterndrawing is a carbon copy of the cutline drawing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;31;It is cut along the black or lead lines with doublebladed scissors or a knife which as it passes through the middle of the black lines simultaneously cuts away a narrow strip of paper thus allowing sufficient space between the segment of glass for the core of the grooved lead,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;32;This core is the supporting wall between the upper and lower flanges of the lead,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;33;Colored glass is then selected from the supply on hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;34;The pattern is placed on a piece of the desired color and with a diamond or steel wheel the glass is cut to the shape of the pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;35;After the glass has been cut the main outlines of the cartoon are painted on each piece of glass with special paint called vitrifiable paint,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;36;This becomes glassy when heated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;37;The painter might apply further paint to the glass in order to control the light and bring all the colors into closer harmony,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;38;During this painting process the glass is held up to the light to simulate the same conditions in which the window will be seen,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;39;The painted pieces are fired in the kiln at least once to fuse the paint and glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;40;The next step is glazing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;41;The cutline drawing is spread out on a table and narrow strips of wood called laths are nailed down along two edges of the drawing to form a right angle,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;42;Long strips of grooved lead are placed along the inside of the laths,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;43;The piece of glass belonging in the angle is fitted into the grooves,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;44;A strip of narrow lead is fitted around the exposed edge or edges and the next required segment slipped into the groove on the other side of the narrow lead,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;45;This is continued until each piece has been inserted into the leads in its proper place according to the outline drawing beneath,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;46;The many joints formed by the leading are then soldered on both sides and the entire window is waterproofed,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;47;After the completed window has been thoroughly inspected in the light the sections are packed and shipped to their destination where they are installed and secured with reinforcing bars,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;48;For faceted glass windows the process begins the same way with the cutline and pattern drawings being made with carbons in a similar manner,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;49;The pattern drawing is then cut to the actual size of the piece of glass with ordinary scissors since there is no core of lead to allow for,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;50;The thick glass slabs next are cut with a sharp doubleedged hammer to the shape of the pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;51;To give the slab an interesting texture the worker then chips round depressions in the glass with the same hammer,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;52;This is called faceting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;53;Instead of glazing with lead a matrix of concrete or epoxy is poured around the pieces of glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;54;The glass pieces have first been glued to the outline drawing which is covered with a heavy coating of transparent grease so that the paper can be removed after the epoxy sets,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;55;The whole is enclosed within a wooden form which is the exact size and shape of the section being made,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;56;The worker must wear gloves during this process since epoxy resin is a toxic material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;57;After hardening the section is cleaned and cured prior to shipping and installation,Relevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;58;The process for making an entire stained glass window can take anywhere from seven to ten weeks since everything must be done by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;59;Cost can vary widely depending on complexity and size though some windows can be created for a cost as low as $500,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;60;The customer can choose an existing pattern rather than create an entirely new one to minimize costs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Stained Glass ;61;In this case the pattern can be customized by altering shapes or by changing the placement of the central image,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;1;Sunscreen products may be manufactured bottled and shipped from a single facility or portions of this work may be handled outside of the company,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;2;The fully automated manufacturing process described here uses some of both approaches,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;3;Water is purified using a method called reverse osmosis,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;4;Reverse osmosis extracts pure fresh water by forcing water under pressure through a semipermeable membrane which separates pure water molecules from salts and other impurities,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;5;Ingredients are purchased from outside sources and mixed with the purified water according to the recipe of the final formulation,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;6;The recipe is recorded on a vat sheet which lists the exact measurements for each ingredient,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;7;Measurements are converted from the initial 10gallon (38 1) recipe used in the development stage to larger quantities for commercial use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;8;A blow molding facility manufactures the plastic containers for the sunscreen,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;9;In some cases this is done outside of the company,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;10;Blow molding is a method in which thermoplastics plastics which soften when heated and harden when cooled are extruded into a tube called a parison and placed into an open mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;11;The mold is closed around the heated parison and the parison is pinched at the bottom to form a seal,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;12;Compressed air is blown through the top of the parison which forces the softened plastic to expand to the inside walls of the mold creating the shape of the container,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;13;Containers are moved to a printing facility where logos and product information are printed and in some cases stamped onto the containers,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;14;Stamping embosses thin metal foil onto the surface of the container in the desired shape usually a logo,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;15;The printed or stamped containers are then stored for use when needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;16;Stainless steel tanks with capacities up to 1000 gallons (3784 1) are used in the filling process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;17;Filling takes place in a separate sterile room with a conveyor system of many incoming tracks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;18;Machine operators monitor the automated process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;19;Containers and caps enter the fill room on conveyor tracks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;20;The sunscreen lotion flows from the vats through stainless steel piping to a pressure filling machine which inserts a retractable nozzle into each container and fills it with a measured amount of sunscreen lotion,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;21;Most containers are capped automatically along the production line,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;22;Some containers include caps with pumps to allow easy dispensing of the sunscreen,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;23;These pump caps require manual assembly by operators as the containers leave the fill phase,Relevant
MadeHow;Sunscreen;24;The filled and capped containers are boxed in quantities of 12 to be pelletized and secured to a skid by shrink wrapping for transport to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;1;Most surfboards are built one at a time in small surfboard shops,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;2;Although techniques and materials vary from one surfboard builder to another the following is a typical process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;3;The foam core or blank is formed in a large cement mold roughly the shape of the surfboard,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;4;The mold is constructed in two halves and the inside is lined with a special paper that keeps the foam from sticking to the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;5;The two halves are clamped together and the mold is heated,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;6;When the liquid polyurethane chemicals are poured into the mold the heat triggers a chemical reaction which begins forming a dense white foam,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;7;Surfboard builders call this process blowing the blank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;8;After 25 minutes the mold is opened and the foam core is taken out and allowed to finish hardening ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;9;Once the core is hard it is cut in half vertically from the nose to the tail ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;10;A thin stringer is glued between the two halves and the core is then clamped back together to dry ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;11;Stringers provide stiffness and help keep the board from breaking in half ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;12;The outline of the finished board is traced onto the rough core using a wooden template as a guide ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;13;The outline is then cut out with a saber saw ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;14;Starting with the bottom of the blank the surface is smoothed and contoured to its final shape with a power planer ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;15;There are no templates or automatic machines to do this job just the trained eye and experienced touch of the surfboard builder ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;16;When the bottom is finished the board is flipped over and the top is shaped,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;17;A power sander removes any ridges left by the planer and the stringer is contoured with a hand plane ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;18;Rough sandpaper is used to shape the sides or rails ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;19;The blank is given a final sanding with fine paper the position for the fin is marked and the builder signs the blank with a special design or signature ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;20;The shaped blank is now ready to be covered with fiberglass and resin to form the hard outer shell of the surfboard ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;21;First the blank is blown clean with compressed air ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;22;If the board is to be colored or have a design on it acrylic paint is applied directly to the foam with a spray gun or airbrush ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;23;When the paint is dry fiberglass cloth is laid over the surface of the blank and cut to fit ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;24;The top of the board or deck is laminated first ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;25;A polyester resin known as a laminating resin is mixed with a second chemical called a catalyst ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;26;This starts a chemical reaction which will cause the resin to harden in 15 minutes ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;27;The resin is poured over the fiberglass and spread evenly using a rubber squeegee ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;28;All of the fiberglass must be covered without leaving too much or too little resin in any spot ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;29;This process is known as glassing ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;30;When the deck is finished the board is flipped over and the process repeated on the bottom ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;31;The board is then flipped once more and the deck is given a second layer of fiberglass and resin for added strength and wear resistance ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;32;The laminating resin remains slightly tacky and rubbery when dry,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;33;A second coat of resin called the filler coat or sanding resin is applied next ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;34;The filler coat fills any surface imperfections left in the laminating resin ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;35;Sometimes this coat is called a hot coat resin and contains wax ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;36;In either case this resin contains a slightly different mix of chemicals which cause it to harden completely ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;37;The deck is coated first and the board is flipped over ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;38;The fin is secured with fiberglass tape and a laminating resin ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;39;When the fin resin is dry the bottom of the board and the fin are given a filler coat ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;40;When both sides are dry a small hole is drilled through the tail to attach the leg leash ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;41;The leg leash is an elastic cord sometimes made of surgical rubber tubing that the surfer attaches to one ankle ,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;42;The leg leash keeps the board from floating away when the surfer falls or wipes out,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;43;Any excess resin must be carefully sanded away,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;44;A power sander is used for the broad surfaces but the rails and other sharply contoured surfaces are hand sanded to avoid gouging into the fiberglass layer,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;45;The board is blown clean with compressed air to remove any residual sanding dust,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;46;On some boards decals or color graphics are added at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;47;A final coat of gloss resin is then brushed onto the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;48;Like the other two layers of resin this final gloss coat is mixed with a catalyst and will harden within 15 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;49;The board is set aside for at least 12 hours to allow the gloss coat to completely harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Surfboard;50;As a final step the board may be wet sanded with very fine sandpaper then rubbed buffed and polished,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;1;Making Tshirts is a fairly simple and largely automated process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;2;Specially designed machines integrate cutting assembling and stitching for the most efficient operations,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;3;The most commonly used seams for Tshirts are narrow superimposed seams which are usually made by placing one piece of fabric onto another and lining up the seam edges,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;4;These seams are frequently stitched with an overedge stitch which requires one needle thread from above and two looper threads from below,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;5;This particular seam and stitch combination results in a flexible finished seam,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;6;Another type of seam that may be used for Tshirts are bound seams in which a narrow piece of fabric is folded around a seam as at the neckline,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;7;These seams may be stitched together using a lockstitch chainstitch or overedge stitch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;8;Depending on the style of the Tshirt the order in which the garment is assembled may vary slightly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;9;The Tshirt style is designed and the dimensions are transferred to patterns,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;10;Adjustments are made for size differences and stylistic preferences,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;11;The Tshirt sections are cut to the dimensions of the patterns,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;12;The pieces consist of a tubed body or separate front and back sections sleeves perhaps pockets and trim,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;13;For fabric that is not tubed the separate pieces for the front and back sections must be stitched together at the sides,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;14;They are joined at the seam lines to form a simple narrow superimposed seam and stitched together using an overedge stitch,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;15;Care must be taken to avoid a needle cutting the yarn of the fabric which can lead to tears in the garment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;16;The hems of sleeves are generally finished before they are fitted into the garment since it is easier to hem the fabric while it is flat,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;17;An automated system moves the sleeves to the sewing head by conveyor,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;18;The edge may be finished by folding it over forming the hem and stitching or by applying a band,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;19;The band may be attached as a superimposed seam or folded over the edge as binding,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;20;If the Tshirt body is tubular the sleeve material is first sewn together and then set into the garment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;21;Alternatively if the Tshirt is cut and sewn the unseamed sleeve is set into place,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;22;Later during the final stage of sewing the shirt the sleeve and side seams are sewn in one action,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;23;The garment hem is commonly sewn with an overedge stitch resulting in a flexible hem,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;24;The tension of the stitch should be loose enough to allow stretching the garment without tearing the fabric,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;25;Alternative hem styles include a combination of edge finishing stitches,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;26;Pockets may be sewn onto Tshirts intended for casual wear,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;27;Higher quality Tshirts will insert an interlining into the pocket so that it maintains its shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;28;The interlining is inserted into the pocket as it is sewn onto the Tshirt front,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;29;Pockets may be attached to the garment with automated setters so the operator only has to arrange the fabric pieces and the mechanical setter positions the pocket and stitches the seam,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;30;Generally shoulder seams require a simple superimposed seam,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;31;Higher quality Tshirt manufacturers may reinforce seams with tape or elastic,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;32;Depending on the style of the Tshirt the seams at the shoulder may be completed before or after the neckband is attached,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;33;For instance if a tubular neckband is to be applied the shoulder seams must first be closed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;34;For crew neck shirts the neck edge should be slightly shorter in circumference than the outer edge where it is attached to the garment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;35;Thus the neckband must be stretched just the right amount to prevent bulging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;36;Tubular neckbands are applied manually,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;37;The bands are folded wrong sides together stretched slightly and aligned with the neckline,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;38;The superimposed seam is stitched with an overedge stitch,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;39;Bound seams are finished with a cover stitch and are easy to achieve,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;40;Bound seams may be used on a variety of neckline styles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;41;The process entails feeding ribbed fabric through machines which fold the fabric and apply tension to it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;42;Some neckbands on lowerpriced shirts are attached separately to the front and back necklines of the garment,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;43;Thus when the shoulder seams are stitched seams are visible on the neckband,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;44;Vnecks require the extra step of either lapping or mitering the neckband,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;45;In the former process one side is folded over the other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;46;A mitered seam is more complex requiring an operator to overlap the band accurately and stitch the band at center front,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;47;An easier method for a Vneck look is to attach the band to the neckline and then sew a tuck to form a V,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;48;Necklines with superimposed seams may be taped so that the shirt is stronger and more comfortable,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;49;Tape may be extended across the back and over the shoulder seams to reinforce this area as well and to flatten the seam,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;50;The seam is then cover stitched or top stitched,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;51;One or more labels are usually attached at the back of the neckline,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;52;Labels provide information about the manufacturer size fabric content and washing instructions,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;53;Some Tshirts will have trim or screen prints added for decorative purposes,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;54;Special Tshirts for infants have larger openings at the head,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;55;The shoulder seams are left open near the neck and buttons or other fasteners are attached,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;56;Tshirts are inspected for flaws in the fabric stitching and thread,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;57;Highquality Tshirts may be pressed through steam tunnels before they are packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;58;Packaging depends on the type of Tshirt and the intended distribution outlet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;TShirt;59;For underwear the shirts are folded and packaged in preprinted bags usually of clear plastic that list information about the product,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;60;Shirts may be boarded or folded around a piece of cardboard so that they maintain their shape during shipping and on the shelf,Relevant
MadeHow;TShirt;61;Finally they are placed into boxes by the dozen or halfdozen,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;1;Traditional withering practices call for manually spreading the leaves in thin layers and exposing them to the open air for 1820 hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;2;Modern factory methods place the leaves in troughs perforated drums or tunnels and expose them to mechanical blasts of hot air,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;3;This process oxidizes the polyphenols or tannins the primary active ingredient and turns the tea leaves a coppery color,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;4;The leaves are crushed either by hand or on rotating tables called rolling machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;5;Either method twists the leaves so that they are eventually coated with their own juices and torn into smaller pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;6;Some companies employ hightech machinery similar to tobaccocutting machines to crush and tear the tea leaves,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;7;Black tea leaves are mechanically dried using a hightemperature method to seal in juices and flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;8;This process turns the leaves to their characteristic black color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;9;Oolong tea leaves are rolled dried and rolled again,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;10;The drying time is shorter than that for black tea therefore the fermentation is less natural and half or less of the polyphenols are oxidized,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;11;Green tea leaves are steamed within 24 hours of harvesting using either moist or dry heat in perforated drums or hot iron pans,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;12;This process destroys enzymes and prevents fermentation and the oxidation of polyphenols,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;13;Herb tea is simply bundled together and hung upside down to air dry,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;14;After the leaves are dried they are brought to a mill room where they are cut with a rotating blade into varying degrees of fineness depending on the type of tea,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;15;The cut leaves are further refined by sifting them through mechanical sieves with meshes of varying grades,Relevant
MadeHow;Tea bag;16;The tea used in tea bags are typically brokengrade or smallsized teas because they require a shorter brewing time,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Telescope;5;The glass manufacturer mixes the proper raw materials with waste glass of the same type as the glass to be made,Relevant
MadeHow;Telescope;6;This waste glass known as cullet acts as a flux that is it causes the raw materials to react together at a lower temperature than they would without it,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Telescope;8;The temperature needed to form molten glass varies with the type of glass being made but it is typically about 2550°F (1400°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Telescope;9;The temperature of the molten glass is raised to about 2820°F (1550°C) to force air bubbles to come to the surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Telescope;10;It is then allowed to cool while being stirred constantly until it has reached about 1830°F (1000°C) at which point it is an extremely thick fluid,Relevant
MadeHow;Telescope;11;This viscous molten glass is poured into molds with roughly the same shape as the lenses required,Relevant
MadeHow;Telescope;12;After the glass has cooled to about 570°F (300°C) it must be reheated to about 1020°F (550°C) to remove internal stresses that form during the initial cooling period and which weaken the glass,Relevant

MadeHow;Tofu;24;Traditionally the curds are pressed with handturned screw presses or simple lever presses,Relevant
MadeHow;Tofu;25;The tofu may be pressed in cheeseclothlined boxes,Relevant

MadeHow;Tofu;35;Pasteurization extends the shelf life of tofu to about 30 days,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Tofu;36;The tofu is then chilled in water until it is ready to be placed into boxes and shipped to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Tofu;37;Tofu must be refrigerated at below 45°F (7°C) to keep it fresh,Relevant
MadeHow;Toothbrush;1;Contemporary toothbrushes are produced mechanically,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Toothbrush;2;Generally toothbrushes consist of plastic handles and nylon or natural boar bristles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Toothbrush;3;Plastic is mixed and shaped into pellets,Relevant
MadeHow;Toothbrush;4;The pellets are then placed in an injection molding machine which heats the plastic until it is melted,Relevant

MadeHow;Traffic Signal;1;A traffic signal is fabricated in the manufacturers plant then installed and wired at the site of the intersection,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;2;The housing or body of each signal stack is die cast as are the lens door and the bulb door which attach to the body,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;3;They may be cast as individual housings and doors for each light or as larger units for each stack,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;4;The diecasting process uses a large twopiece steel mold called a die,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;5;Inside the mold called the cavity is the reverse image of the part to be cast,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;6;The die is placed in a machine which clamps the two halves together with a force of 2400000 pounds (1090000 kg),Relevant

MadeHow;Traffic Signal;11;Under normal conditions a diecasting machine like this can produce about 30 parts per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;12;Once the cast part is cooled it is trimmed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;13;The trimming process uses a stamping die to shear off any excess metal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;14;The part is then visually inspected and a hand file is used to remove any sharp burrs,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;15;The points where the doors are to mount to the housing are machined to ensure they will fit properly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;16;The doors are attached to the housing with hinge pins and retained by spring latches,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;17;If the housings and doors have been cast individually they are assembled to form the stack,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;18;The holes used for fastening the stack to the support structure are drilled,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;19;The stack is cleaned painted and placed in a drying oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;20;The painted stack is transferred to a final assembly area where the lamps lampholders reflectors and lenses are installed,Relevant

MadeHow;Traffic Signal;23;The sheet metal visors which were fabricated in another operation are attached to each light,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;24;Wiring from each light is routed through the hollow stack housing to the stack mounting point,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;25;The housing for the electrical controller may be cast or fabricated,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;26;It is trimmed machined and painted in much the same manner as the signal stack,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;27;Inside it has mounting points to which the electrical control boards are attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;28;The traffic signal manufacturer may assemble the electrical components or may have this done by another company,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;29;The supports may be cast spun or fabricated,Relevant
MadeHow;Traffic Signal;30;Supports are hollow with an electrical junction box built into the base to connect with the wires coming underground from the controller,Relevant

MadeHow;Vaccine;1;Manufacturing an antivirus vaccine today is a complicated process even after the arduous task of creating a potential vaccine in the laboratory,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;2;The change from manufacturing a potential vaccine in small quantities to manufacturing gallons of safe vaccine in a production situation is dramatic and simple laboratory procedure may not be amenable to a scale up situation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;3;Manufacturing begins with small amounts of a specific virus (or seed),Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;4;The virus must be free of impurities including other similar viruses and even variations of the same type of virus,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;5;Additionally the seed must be kept under ideal conditions usually frozen that prevent the virus from becoming either stronger or weaker than desired,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;6;Stored in small glass or plastic containers amounts as small as only 5 or 10 cubic centimeters but containing thousands if not millions of viruses will eventually lead to several hundred liters of vaccine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;7;Freezers are maintained at specified temperatures charts andor dials outside of the freezer keep a continuous record of the temperature,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;8;Sensors will set off audible alarm signals andor computer alarms if the freezer temperature goes out of range,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;9;After defrosting and warming the seed virus under carefully specified conditions (ie at room temperature or in a water bath) the small amount of virus cells is placed into a cell factory a small machine that with the addition of an appropriate medium allows the virus cells to multiply,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;10;Each type of virus grows best in a medium specific to it established in premanufacturing laboratory procedures but all contain proteins from mammals in one form or another such as purified protein from cow blood,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;11;The medium also contains other proteins and organic compounds that encourage the reproduction of the virus cells,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;12;As far as the virus is concerned the medium in a cell factory is a host for reproduction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;13;Mixed with the appropriate medium at appropriate temperature and with a predetermined amount of time viruses will multiply,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;14;In addition to temperature other factors must be monitored including the pH of the mixture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;15;pH is a measure of acidity or basicity measured on a scale from 0 to 14 and the viruses must be kept at a defined pH within the cell factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;16;Plain water which is neither acidic or basic (neutral) has a pH of 7,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;17;Although the container in which the cells are growing is not very large (perhaps the size of a 48 quart pot) there are an impressive number of valves tubes and sensors connected to it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;18;Sensors monitor pH and temperature and there are various connections for adding media or chemicals such as oxygen to maintain the pH places to withdraw samples for microscopic analysis and sterile arrangements for adding the components of the cell factory and withdrawing the intermediate product when it is ready,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;19;The virus from the cell factory is then separated from the medium and placed in a second medium for additional growth,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;20;Early methods of 40 or 50 years ago used a bottle to hold the mixture and the resulting growth was a single layer of viruses floating on the medium,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;21;It was soon discovered that if the bottle was turned while the viruses were growing even more virus could be produced because a layer of virus grew on all inside surfaces of the bottle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;22;An important discovery in the 1940s was that cell growth is greatly stimulated by the addition of enzymes to a medium the most commonly used of which is trypsin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;23;An enzyme is a protein that also functions as a catalyst in the feeding and growth of cells,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;24;In current practice bottles are not used at all,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;25;The growing virus is kept in a container larger than but similar to the cell factory and mixed with beads near microscopic particles to which the viruses can attach themselves,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;26;The use of the beads provides the virus with a much greater area to attach themselves to and consequently a much greater growth of virus,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;27;As in the cell factory temperature and pH are strictly controlled,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;28;Time spent in growing virus varies according to the type of virus being produced and is in each case a closely guarded secret of the manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;29;When there is a sufficient number of viruses they are separated from the beads in one or more ways,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;30;The broth might be forced through a filter with openings large enough to allow the viruses to pass through but small enough to prevent the beads from passing,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;31;The mixture might be centrifuged several times to separate the virus from the beads in a container from which they can then be drawn off,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;32;Still another alternative might be to flood the bead mixture with another medium which washes the virus off the beads,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;33;The eventual vaccine will be either made of attenuated (weakened) virus or a killed virus,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;34;The choice of one or the other depends on a number of factors including the efficacy of the resulting vaccine and its secondary effects,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;35;Ru vaccine which is developed almost every year in response to new variants of the causative virus is always an attenuated vaccine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;36;The virulence of a virus can dictate the choice rabies vaccine for example is always a killed vaccine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;37;If the vaccine is attenuated the virus is usually attenuated before it goes through the production process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;38;Carefully selected strains are cultured (grown) repeatedly in various media,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;39;There are strains of viruses that actually become stronger as they grow,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;40;These strains are clearly unusable for an attenuated vaccine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;41;Other strains become too weak as they are cultured repeatedly and these too are unacceptable for vaccine use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;42;Like the porridge chair and bed that Goldilocks liked only some viruses are just right reaching a level of attenuation that makes them acceptable for vaccine use and not changing in strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;43;Recent molecular technology has made possible the attenuation of live virus by molecular manipulation but this method is still rare,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;44;The virus is then separated from the medium in which it has been grown,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;45;Vaccines which are of several types (as most are) are combined before packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;46;The actual amount of vaccine given to a patient will be relatively small compared with the medium in which it is given,Relevant
MadeHow;Vaccine;47;Decisions about whether to use water alcohol or some other solution for an injectable vaccine for example are made after repeated tests for safety sterility and stability,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;1;The first step in making a violin is to make the sides (ribs) from which the outline of the top and back will be taken,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;2;The ribs are constructed on an inside mold which is a wooden form about 15 to 18 mm thick cut to the exact outline of the inside of the violin,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;3;Pieces of wood for the corner and end blocks are cut to approximate size and temporarily glued to cutouts on the mold at the proper locations,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;4;With the aid of a pattern and using gouges and files the blocks are trimmed to the final shape of the inside contour of the violin,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;5;Slices of maple slightly wider than the height of the ribs which are about 30 to 32 mm for a violin are cut and planed to a thickness of 1 mm,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;6;Pieces are bent to the shape of the mold and blocks using a heated metal form,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;7;After trimming to slightly longer than the final length the ribs are glued,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;8;To hold the ribs in place until the glue dries countermolds shaped to match the outside contours of the ribs at the corners and ends are used,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;9;Pressure is applied by clamps or wrapping with string,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;10;Care must be taken to avoid gluing the ribs to the mold which must be removed in a subsequent step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;11;The ribs are glued in sequence starting with the middle bouts which must be trimmed to final length at the corners before the upper and lower ribs can be added,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;12;The linings strips of willow or spruce about 2 by 8 mm are bent to shape using the bending iron cut to length and glued to the inside of the ribs,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;13;The corners are trimmed to their final shape and the top and bottom surfaces of the ribs linings and blocks are planed and filed to be level at the final height,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;14;The tops of violins are almost always made from a wedge of wood which is cut or split with the edges of resulting pieces glued together,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;15;This joint for which the pieces must fit with absolute perfection then becomes the centerline of the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;16;Maple for the backs of violins is treated the same way to make a twopiece back however it is possible to find a piece wide enough to make a onepiece back,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;17;Planing the wood to create a perfect center joint is an exacting task,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;18;After the pieces have been planed to fit well—as seen by holding the pieces together in front of a light—the edge of one piece is coated with chalk and rubbed against the mating edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;19;The areas in which chalk is transferred from one piece to the other identify places which must be shaved slightly with the plane to perfect the fit,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;20;This chalk fitting procedure is repeated until the fit between the two pieces is perfect after which they are glued together and clamped,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;21;After gluing the center joint the flat side of the back and top are planed flat,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;22;The ribs are placed on this flat side a tracing around the ribs enlarged by 3 mm establishes the outline of the top or back (a 20 mm square is added at the top of the back for the button),Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;23;These outlines are cut out using a bow or coping saw many modern violin makers use a power band or scroll saw,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;24;The outside arching of the top and back are next carved using gouges thumb planes and scrapers for the final smoothing,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;25;Five transverse and one longitudinal arching guides are consulted frequently as the plates take shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;26;The arching guides which are different for the top and back plus the outline embodied in the mold determine the design or model of the instrument,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;27;Most modern makers follow or copy the designs of great makers such as Stradivari or Guameri while some have evolved their own,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;28;Next the interior sides of the top and back are carved out,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;29;The final thicknesses of the wood has a major influence on the acoustic performance of the finished instrument and there are many systems in use for arriving at the optimum distribution of thicknesses,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;30;In general most methods involve testing the resonance frequencies of the plates by tapping flexing or exciting them with sound coupled with measurements of the thickness of the plate at many locations using a graduation caliper,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;31;Then depending on the results and on the desired outcome wood is gradually removed from various locations,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;32;Usually makers seek to establish certain relationships eg octaves between the various resonances of each plate and between the two plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;33;Typical thicknesses of a finished back are 45 mm at the center decreasing to 24 to 25 mm in the upper and lower bouts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;34;The thicknesses of the top are more uniform about 3 mm overall and perhaps slightly thicker between the soundholes in the area of the soundpost,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;35;The outline of the sound holes is transferred to the top and these are cut out using a sharp knife some makers use a punch or drill to cut the round holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;36;The bassbar is made of very straight grained quartercut spruce (much like the top),Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;37;The area where it fits is outlined on the side of the top and the rough blank is trimmed to precisely fit the arching,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;38;The chalkfitting method is employed again in this step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;39;The bar is then glued in place and trimmed to its final contour,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;40;This again involves testing the resonance of the top which was altered by the cutting of the sound holes as well as the addition of the bassbar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;41;The mold is now removed from the rib assembly by loosening the temporary glue bonds of the blocks to the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;42;The top and back are then glued to the ribs,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;43;The glue holding the back should be fullstrength,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;44;Thinner weaker glue is used for the top this provides for easy removal if service or adjustment is necessary and will allow the seams to open in extremes of humidity and temperature rather than produce cracks in the wood itself,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;45;The groove for the purfling is marked a precise distance from the edges using a purfling cutter,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;46;The groove is deepened with a sharp knife and the wood in the groove removed with a purfling pick,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;47;The purfling strips which can be bought ready or made by the violin maker are bent to fit the groove using the bending iron,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;48;The pieces are then cut to the exact length mitered to fit the corners and glued in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;49;The channels which run over the purfling just inside the edges are cut with a gouge and blended into the arching with gouge planes and scrapers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;50;Finally the edge is rounded using knife file and perhaps sandpaper,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;51;(This is one of the only places in which sandpaper is used in the construction of a violin),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;52;All of the other surfaces should be finished with scrapers which provides a crisp appearance to the workmanship and best reveals the beauty of the wood,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;53;A block of maple matching the back is squared on the sides and top with a plane,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;54;Next the outline of the side view of the neck and scroll is traced on the quartercut side of the block,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;55;The wood outside the outline is sawed away,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;56;Patterns and outlines for the peg box top surface of the neck and the scroll are traced,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;57;A razor saw is then used to cut away wood around the scroll and neck outlines,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;58;Gouges and scrapers are used to finish the carving of the scroll the details of which are one of the ways in which the violin maker expresses his individuality,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;59;The pegbox is excavated using chisels and gouges,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;60;The neck is cut to final dimensions using planes knives and scrapers,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;61;A mortise (cavity) to receive the neck is cut into the upper ribs block and top of the violins body,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;62;The cut of the mortise and the root of the neck must be very precise since the correct height and angle of the neck are critical to achieving a good tonal result,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;63;Chalk fitting is again employed,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;64;The neck is then glued into the mortise and the final shaping of the heel of the neck and the button on the back is done,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;65;There is a great deal of lore associated with the varnishing of violins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;66;It has even been asserted that secret recipes are responsible for the extraordinary tonal characteristics of the old Italian violins,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;67;Regardless of its possible effects on tone it is certainly true that the varnish does serve other important purposes of beautifying the appearance and protecting the wood from wear damage moisture and dirt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;68;Thus the selection and application of varnish is vitally important,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;69;Because there are many types of varnish and working methods the following rather general outline of finishing is provided The finished violin is hung up to age for a time (in some cases several months or more) and may be exposed to sunlight,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;70;This will cause the wood to darken and bring out its figure,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;71;Many makers use less timeconsuming alternatives,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;72;The vamish is applied in several coats,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;73;This may include coats of clear vamish followed by additional coats of colored varnish,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;74;Vamish is essentially a coating consisting of resins which may be natural substances (eg copal or seedlac) or manmade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;75;Color is imparted to vamishes by adding pigments or dyes,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;76;The color of the individual coats may be varied to produce the desired appearance,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;77;Following the colored vamish an additional coat or two of clear vamish may be applied to protect the layers underneath,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;78;Since oldlooking violins are more appealing to many players some makers antique their instruments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;79;The various methods of antiquing are usually trade secrets and makers pride themselves on their individual results,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;80;The surface of the fully dried vamish may be rubbed out using some combination of abrasives (pumice rottenstone fine emery paper etc) and polishes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;81;The part of the neck between the heel and the peg box is not varnished,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;82;Rather it is stained sanded very smooth with fine emery paper and french polished (an application of shellac andor alcohol and oil),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;83;The top of the neck is planed flat and the underside of the ebony fmgerboard is planed to fit and glued in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;84;The sides and top are finished with planes scrapers and emery paper to be smooth and to have exactly the correct curvature,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;85;Gauges and straightedge are consulted frequently during this process,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;86;The ebony nut is cut to size lightly glued at the top of the fingerboard dressed to final shape and grooves filed for the strings,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;87;A mortise is cut at the bottom of the violin into which is glued the ebony saddle,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;88;The pegs are shaved to the proper taper and diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;89;Peg holes are drilled and reamed to match the pegs,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;90;Likewise a hole at the bottom of the ribs is drilled reamed and fitted with the end pin,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;91;The bridge and soundpost are the last parts to be fashioned their fit and position greatly affect the sound and playing qualities of the violin,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;92;Starting with a precut blank the feet of the bridge are cut to fit the arching of the top at the proper position—between the nicks of the soundholes,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;93;The top of the bridge is cut to an arch which matches the curvature of the fmgerboard and provides the proper height of the strings,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;94;The front side (facing the neck) is planed down to a thickness of about 45 mm at the bottom and tapering from the middle to 15 mm at the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;95;Grooves for the strings are cut and filed using a gauge to establish their proper position and spacing,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;96;The soundpost transmits the vibrations of the strings to the back of the violin,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;97;It is cut from a round piece of straightgrained spruce about 6 mm in diameter,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;98;Its length and ends must be cut so that it fits precisely in the proper location inside the violin about 3 mm behind the treble foot of the bridge,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;99;A gauge may be used to measure the approximate length of the soundpost but the final fit is a trial and error process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin;100;The soundpost is inserted and its position adjusted through the soundholes using a special tool,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;101;The strings are now fitted into the tailpiece extended over the bridge and wound on the pegs,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;102;Once all four strings are installed they may be tuned up to pitch and the violin played for the first time,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;103;What follows will be a period of adjustment as the violin becomes accustomed to the tension of the strings and their vibration,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin;104;Numerous adjustments to the position of the soundpost the bridge types of strings and perhaps other factors are usually necessary to optimize the tonal characteristics and playability,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;1;Roughing the stick refers to the process of carving and planing the stick to its approximate finished dimensions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;2;The squared off blank of Pemnambuco wood is either held across the corner of a bench or along the length of a special board and planed by hand with specially designed planes fashioning the stick into its characteristic octagon shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;3;Using a direct heat device such as a spirit lamp or gas burner the stick is heated slowly until it becomes flexible enough to bend,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;4;When ready the stick is bent into an approximate or rough curve,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;5;When cooled the stick is set aside and the work on the frog begins,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;6;The frog begins with the fashioning of the metal fittings,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;7;Several parts require soldering as well as bending and shaping,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;8;The ferrule much like a half round ring is a semicircular length of sheet silver soldered to a flat one,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;9;The button for the adjuster needs one or two silver rings,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;10;The other metal parts include a silver liner which is shaped to three facets of an octagon on a steel die to conform to the three facets on which it will contact the stick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;11;If the frog is designed with a back plate the plate is shaped and bent to the 90 degree angle of the back of the frog where it is to be inlaid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;12;The ebony wedge is trimmed to length and planed true to its center on all sides with a small razor sharp block plane,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;13;The various metal fittings are fit onto the frog in their respective places,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;14;Although modern commercial manufacture uses milling machinery to accomplish this part the best modern builders have no problem doing this work by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;15;The fitting of the metal to the frog begins with drilling a 3mm hole called the throat just under the area where the ferrule is located,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;16;The ferrule is fit onto the wider part of the throat with a knife and small chisels until it fits back flush and level,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;17;The sides are shaped concave with a gouge,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;18;The slot for the pearl slide with its 20 degree undercut sides is next to be shaved out with the chisels,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;19;The cavity for the hair called the hair mortise is drilled and carved into the frog with a bow drill and chisel,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;20;The liner is then fit to the narrow edge of the frogs length using the chisels,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;21;The liner conformns to the top three facets of the sticks octagonal shape and is the bearing surface of the frog against the stick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;22;A tapered silver backplate extending from the back of the pearl slide slot to the center facet of the liner is inlaid to the flat end of the frog,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;23;The frog is then shaped using a knife files and small scrapers made of thin steel sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;24;The decorations called the eyes are inlaid into the sides of the frog at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;25;Then the ebony dowel for the adjuster button is fashioned separately on a lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;26;After the frog is done the next job is to fit it to the roughed out stick,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;27;This is done by chalking the liner of the frog and rubbing it against the facets of the stick at the point where the frog makes contact,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;28;Through a process of marking the stick in this way and carefully planing scraping and filing the marks away the frog is brought into the proper contact with the three bottom facets,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;29;Then holes are drilled in the stick for the screw and eye assembly which attaches the frog to the brass nut at the end of the stick,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;30;The first step here is to fit an ivory plate to the head or tip of the bow,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;31;A plate of ivory is prepared with a raised section for the right angle of the beak with a thin lamination of ebony veneer all along its inside surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;32;The ivory is glued to the bottom face of the head,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;33;The shaping of the head is done with a knife and files,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;34;This work usually follows an established model and is accomplished with the means of a pattern or template which is alternately traced and compared with the carving as it progresses,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;35;The elegant head models of the classic bows are often very beautiful and have inspired connoisseurs the world over to collect them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;36;All the great bowmakers imprinted their work with their own personal style and experts are easily able to recognize most of the important styles each head being akin to the signature of the maker,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;37;Once the head is finished the mortise for the hair is cut into it and the finishing of the stick can continue,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;38;The stick must be now brought into final dimension a process called graduation,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;39;The stick tapers from 3443210 mm just behind the head to 6444135 mm at the button end,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;40;Using a gauge or caliper the craftsman skillfully planes this transition of thickness into the stick,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;41;The whole process must be done while preserving the integrity of a perfect octagon,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;42;The octagons transition into the head is most difficult and ends with the top three facets converging upwards the two side facets becoming the side of the head and the bottom three becoming the back of the head and the chamfers (a thin finish cut at a 45 degree angle to the sides),Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;43;All of this work is accomplished with either the plane in the case of the facets or the knife and file for the detailing of the head,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;44;The stick is simply held by hand across a flat board or the corner of the workbench while planing the facets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;45;The head is simply held in the hand while finishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;46;If the stick is to be finished round as many are the edges of the octagon are planed away after graduation and the stick is rounded off in this manner to an area about 14423 34 inches (46 cm) in front of the frog,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;47;The area where one holds the bow is almost always octagonal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;48;The bow usually has no real varnish as such because Pernambuco is inherently dark and oily,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;49;But the stick may be subjected to a number of chemical treatments to achieve its characteristic chocolate brown color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;50;Bathing the stick with nitric acid and then following with a neutralizing exposure to ammonia fumes is the most common color treatment,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;51;The bow is given additional sheen and protection by a technique known as French polishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;52;This involves the application of a dilute solution of shellac sometimes mixed with other gums or resins with a lightly oiled rag held wrapped around the fingers The roughing and finishing of bow sticks do not vary in technique from hand making to commercial manufacture Most violin bows are made completely by hand Only the speed of production quality of materials and diligence in finishing distinguish the difference between the mediocre and the sublime 6 The lapping or winding acts as a grip for the stick and is often called the grip,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;53;It usually covers a 3inch (76 cm) length starting from just in front of the frog and going toward the tip,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;54;It consists of some material usually silver wire wound in a compact spiral fashion around the stick,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;55;Part of the winding nearest the frog is covered with leather to protect the spot where the players thumb rests,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;56;The hairing of the bow is quite routine as the hair wears from playing and must be frequently replaced,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;57;The horsehair is purchased already selected drawn and bundled in uniform lengths,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;58;A small amount is separated from this and a small rosined knot is fashioned at one end using very strong thin thread,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;59;The knot is made stronger by inserting the end of the hair into the heat of a flame and expanding the hair behind it,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;60;A small wooden plug is carved to fit the mortise in the head and the hair is turned under and fastened into the head with this plug which holds the hair spread across the top edge in a neat uniform flat strip,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;61;With the frog all the way forward the hair is measured to length cut off and after much combing and arranging tied in a similar way at the end near the frog,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;62;Another wooden plug is fashioned for the mortise of the frog,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;63;The ferrule is slid over the hair and after much more combing the hair is turned over and fastened again with a wooden plug this time into the frog,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;64;The hair is combed again before pushing in the pearl slide and again after sliding on the ferrule,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;65;A wooden wedge is carved to fit the width of the ferrule so as to hold the hair spread in a ribbonlike fashion,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;66;After some more combing the wedge is pushed into the ferrule against the hair and trimmed off with a knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Violin Bow;67;With the application of some rosin on the hair for grip the new bow is ready to play,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;1;Truckloads of grain are shipped directly from farms to the whiskey manufacturer to be stored in silos until needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;2;The grain is inspected and cleaned to remove all dust and other foreign particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;3;All grains except barley are first ground into meal in a gristmill,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;4;The meal is then mixed with water and cooked to break down the cellulose walls that contain starch granules,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;5;This can be done in a closed pressure cooker at temperatures of up to 311°F (155°C) or more slowly in an open cooker at 212°F (100°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;6;Instead of being cooked barley is malted,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;7;The first step in malting barley consists of soaking it in water until it is thoroughly saturated,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;8;It is then spread out and sprinkled with water for about three weeks at which time it begins to sprout,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;9;During this germination the enzyme amylase is produced which converts the starch in the barley into sugars,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;10;The sprouting is halted by drying the barley and heating it with hot air from a kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;11;For Scotch whiskey the fuel used in the kiln includes peat a soft carbonrich substance formed when plant matter decomposes in water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;12;The peat gives Scotch whiskey a characteristic smoky taste,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;13;The malted barley is then ground like other grains,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;14;Mashing consists of mixing cooked grain with malted barley and warm water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;15;The amylase in the malted barley converts the starch in the other grains into sugars,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;16;After several hours the mixture is converted into a turbid sugarrich liquid known as mash,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;17;(In making Scotch malt whiskey the mixture consists only of malted barley and water),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;18;After mashing the mixture is filtered to produce a sugarrich liquid known as wort,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;19;The mash or wort is transferred to a fermentation vessel usually closed in Scotland and open in the United States,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;20;These vessels may be made of wood or stainless steel,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;21;Yeast is added to begin fermentation in which the singlecelled yeast organisms convert the sugars in the mash or wort to alcohol,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;22;The yeast may be added in the form of new neverused yeast cells (the sweet mash process) or in the form of a portion of a previous batch of fermentation (the sour mash process),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;23;The sour mash method is more often used because it is effective at room temperature and its low pH (high acidity) promotes yeast growth and inhibits the growth of bacteria,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;24;The sweet mash method is more difficult to control and it must be used at temperatures above 80°F (27°C) to speed up the fermentation and to avoid bacterial contamination,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;25;After three or four days the end product of fermentation is a liquid containing about 10 alcohol known as distillers beer in the United States or wash in Scotland,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;26;Scottish whiskeymakers often distill their wash in traditional copper pot stills,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;27;The wash is heated so that most of the alcohol (which boils at 172°F [78°C]) is transformed into vapor but most of the water (which boils at 212°F [100°C]) is not,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;28;This vapor is transferred back into liquid alcohol in a watercooled condenser and collected,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;29;Most modern distilleries use a continuous still,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;30;This consists of a tall cylindrical column filled with a series of perforated plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;31;Steam enters the still from the bottom and distillers beer enters from the top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;32;The beer is distilled as it slowly drips through the plates and the alcohol is condensed back into a liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;33;With either method the product of the initial distillation—known as low wine—is distilled a second time to produce a product known as high wine or new whiskey which contains about 70 alcohol,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;34;The temperature of distillation and other factors determine the proportions of water alcohol and other substances (called congeners) in the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;35;If it contains more than 95 alcohol it will have no flavor because it has no congeners,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;36;This product is known as grain neutral spirit and is often used to add alcohol without adding taste during blending,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;37;If the final product has too many congeners of the wrong kind it will taste bad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;38;Distillers remove badtasting congeners (usually aldehydes acids esters and higher alcohols) in various ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;39;Some congeners boil at a lower temperature than alcohol and can be boiled off,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;40;Some are lighter than alcohol and will float on top where they can be poured off,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;41;Tennessee whiskey is unique in that the high wine is filtered through charcoal before it is aged,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;42;The charcoal is produced by burnning wood from sugar maples,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;43;This filtration removes unwanted congeners and results in a particularly smooth whiskey,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;44;Premium Tennessee whiskey may be filtered through charcoal again after it is aged to produce an even smoother product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;45;Water is added to the high wine to reduce its alcohol content to about 50 or 60 for American whiskeys and about 65 or higher for Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;46;Scotch whiskeys are aged in cool wet conditions so they absorb water and become less alcoholic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;47;American whiskeys are aged in warmer drier conditions so they lose water and become more alcoholic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;48;Whiskey is aged in wooden barrels usually made from charred white oak,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;49;White oak is used because it is one of the few woods that can hold a liquid without leaking but which also allows the water in the whiskey to move back and forth within the pores of the wood which helps to add flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;50;In the United States these barrels are usually new and are only used once,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;51;In most other countries it is common to reuse old barrels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;52;New barrels add more flavor than used barrels resulting in differences in the taste of American and foreign whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;53;The aging process is a complex one still not fully understood but at least three factors are involved,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;54;First the original mixture of water alcohol and congeners react with each other over time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;55;Second these ingredients react with oxygen in the outside air in oxidation reactions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;56;Third the water absorbs substances from the wood as it moves within it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;57;(Charring the wood makes these substances more soluble in water),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;58;All these factors change the flavor of the whiskey,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;59;Whiskey generally takes at least three or four years to mature and many whiskeys are aged for ten or fifteen years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;60;Straight whiskeys and single malt Scotch whiskeys are not blended that is they are produced from single batches and are ready to be bottled straight from the barrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;61;All other whiskeys are blended,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;62;Different batches of whiskey are mixed together to produce a better flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;63;Often neutral grain spirit is added to lighten the flavor caramel is added to standardize the color and a small amount of sherry or port wine is added to help the flavors blend,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;64;Blended Scotch whiskey usually consists of several batches of strongly flavored malt whiskeys mixed with less strongly flavored grain whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;65;A few blends contain only malt whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;66;Blending is often considered the most difficult and critical process in producing premium Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;67;A premium blended Scotch whiskey may contain more than 60 individual malt whiskeys which must be blended in the proper proportions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;68;Glass is always used to store mature whiskey because it does not react with it to change the flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;69;Modern distilleries use automated machinery to produce as many as 400 bottles of whiskey per minute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;70;The glass bottles move down a conveyor belt as they are cleaned filled capped sealed labeled and placed in cardboard boxes,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 1;71;The whiskey is ready to be shipped to liquor stores bars and restaurants,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;1;Truckloads of grain are shipped directly from farms to the whiskey manufacturer to be stored in silos until needed,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Whiskey 2;27;The wash is heated so that most of the alcohol (which boils at 172°F [78°C]) is transformed into vapor but most of the water (which boils at 212°F [100°C]) is not,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;28;This vapor is transferred back into liquid alcohol in a watercooled condenser and collected,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;29;Most modern distilleries use a continuous still,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;30;This consists of a tall cylindrical column filled with a series of perforated plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;31;Steam enters the still from the bottom and distillers beer enters from the top,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;32;The beer is distilled as it slowly drips through the plates and the alcohol is condensed back into a liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;33;With either method the product of the initial distillation—known as low wine—is distilled a second time to produce a product known as high wine or new whiskey which contains about 70 alcohol,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;34;The temperature of distillation and other factors determine the proportions of water alcohol and other substances (called congeners) in the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;35;If it contains more than 95 alcohol it will have no flavor because it has no congeners,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;36;This product is known as grain neutral spirit and is often used to add alcohol without adding taste during blending,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;37;If the final product has too many congeners of the wrong kind it will taste bad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;38;Distillers remove badtasting congeners (usually aldehydes acids esters and higher alcohols) in various ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;39;Some congeners boil at a lower temperature than alcohol and can be boiled off,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;40;Some are lighter than alcohol and will float on top where they can be poured off,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;41;Tennessee whiskey is unique in that the high wine is filtered through charcoal before it is aged,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;42;The charcoal is produced by burnning wood from sugar maples,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;43;This filtration removes unwanted congeners and results in a particularly smooth whiskey,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;44;Premium Tennessee whiskey may be filtered through charcoal again after it is aged to produce an even smoother product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;45;Water is added to the high wine to reduce its alcohol content to about 50 or 60 for American whiskeys and about 65 or higher for Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;46;Scotch whiskeys are aged in cool wet conditions so they absorb water and become less alcoholic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;47;American whiskeys are aged in warmer drier conditions so they lose water and become more alcoholic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;48;Whiskey is aged in wooden barrels usually made from charred white oak,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;49;White oak is used because it is one of the few woods that can hold a liquid without leaking but which also allows the water in the whiskey to move back and forth within the pores of the wood which helps to add flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;50;In the United States these barrels are usually new and are only used once,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;51;In most other countries it is common to reuse old barrels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;52;New barrels add more flavor than used barrels resulting in differences in the taste of American and foreign whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;53;The aging process is a complex one still not fully understood but at least three factors are involved,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;54;First the original mixture of water alcohol and congeners react with each other over time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;55;Second these ingredients react with oxygen in the outside air in oxidation reactions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;56;Third the water absorbs substances from the wood as it moves within it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;57;(Charring the wood makes these substances more soluble in water),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;58;All these factors change the flavor of the whiskey,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;59;Whiskey generally takes at least three or four years to mature and many whiskeys are aged for ten or fifteen years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;60;Straight whiskeys and single malt Scotch whiskeys are not blended that is they are produced from single batches and are ready to be bottled straight from the barrel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;61;All other whiskeys are blended,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;62;Different batches of whiskey are mixed together to produce a better flavor,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;63;Often neutral grain spirit is added to lighten the flavor caramel is added to standardize the color and a small amount of sherry or port wine is added to help the flavors blend,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;64;Blended Scotch whiskey usually consists of several batches of strongly flavored malt whiskeys mixed with less strongly flavored grain whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;65;A few blends contain only malt whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;66;Blending is often considered the most difficult and critical process in producing premium Scotch whiskeys,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;67;A premium blended Scotch whiskey may contain more than 60 individual malt whiskeys which must be blended in the proper proportions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;68;Glass is always used to store mature whiskey because it does not react with it to change the flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;69;Modern distilleries use automated machinery to produce as many as 400 bottles of whiskey per minute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;70;The glass bottles move down a conveyor belt as they are cleaned filled capped sealed labeled and placed in cardboard boxes,Relevant
MadeHow;Whiskey 2;71;The whiskey is ready to be shipped to liquor stores bars and restaurants,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;1;Zinc ores are dug from underground mines using conventional blasting drilling and hauling techniques,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;2;The ores occur as zinc sulfide (also called sphalerite) zinc carbonate (smithsonite) zinc silicate (calimine) and in compounds of manganese and iron (franklinite),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;3;Zinc ore is sometimes mined in conjunction with silver or lead ores,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;4;In addition to the ore itself oil and sulfuric acid are required for the breakdown of the ores and electricity coke or natural gas are needed to provide the heat energy for smelting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;5;Zinc can be produced by a process called froth flotation which is also used for reduction of copper and lead ores,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;6;This process involves grinding the zinc ore to a fine powder mixing it with water pine oil and flotation chemicals and then agitating the mixture to float the zinc to the surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;7;A variety of chemicals are used to coat the important zinc particles and prevent them from becoming wetted by the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;8;Then air is injected and the coated minerals attach themselves to the bubbles,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;9;The operation is performed inside a vat and agitated with an impeller,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;10;The rotating impeller draws the air down the standpipe that surrounds the impeller shaft and dissipates it throughout the mixture or pulp,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;11;The zinc rises to the top and the residue stays in the bottom of the pulp since it cannot adhere to the bubbles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;12;Automatic scrapers remove the mineralladen froth containing the zinc,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;13;The froth is filtered to remove the water and liquid oils,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;14;The pastelike remainder is mixed with lime and sent to a furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;15;The furnace roasts the mixture at 2500°F (1371°C) which fuses the minerals into solid chunks called sinter,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;16;At this point the material has been completely converted to zinc oxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;17;The next reduction process uses a blast furnace to melt the prepared ore into its elemental components,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;18;The blast furnace is fueled by electricity coke or natural gas which generate temperatures of up to 2200°F (1204°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;19;This however also generates carbon dioxide which recombines with the zinc as it cools to reform zinc oxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;20;To reduce this reformation the zinc is sprayed with molten lead while it is still hot,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;21;The lead at 1022°F (550°C) dissolves the zinc and carries it to another chamber where it is cooled to 824°F (440°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;22;At this temperature the lighter zinc separates out of the lead and is drained off the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;23;The lead is reheated and returned to the blast furnace,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;24;Further metal improvement can be made by keeping the zinc molten and undisturbed for several hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;25;In this state iron and other contaminants settle to the bottom allowing the almost pure zinc to be carefully drawn off the top and cast into ingots,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;26;Most zinc is alloyed with other metals before use to improve its properties,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;27;Alloying involves remelting and mixing the zinc with other metals in precise proportions,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;28;For example approximately 4 aluminum is added to improve casting quality and die life in the diecasting process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Zinc;29;Other added alloys are small amounts of titanium copper and magnesium,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;30;After alloying the molten metal is poured into sow molds and ingot molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Zinc;31;Sows can weigh several thousand pounds while ingots weigh about 45 pounds (20 kg),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;1;The manufacture of an accordion is not a completely automated process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;2;In a sense all accordions could be called handmade since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;3;The general process involves making the individual parts assembling the subsections assembling the entire instrument and final decorating and packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;4;Depending on the manufacturer the parts of an accordion can be supplied by outside manufacturers or made inhouse,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;5;The wooden parts are typically cut into the appropriate shapes by jigs and presses,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;6;This is an automated process in which the wood passes by these machines and is then cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;7;This system significantly simplifies the repeated making of identical components and ensures they are made with a high degree of precision,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;8;The plastic components of the accordion such as the buttons and keys are usually produced by injection molding,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;9;In this approach plastic is supplied as granules or powder and is fed into a large hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;10;It is then heated converting it into a liquid that can then be forcibly injected into a mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;11;After it cools it solidifies and maintains its shape after the die is opened,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;12;Various processes are used to construct the many metal parts of an accordion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;13;These typically involve melting the metal to a liquid form then placing it in a preformed mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;14;When the metal is cooled and hardened the mold is opened and the part is complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;15;In the case of the reeds the metal is specially treated by a process called tempering,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;16;This reduces the hardness and brittleness of the metal making it more ductile and tough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;17;After the individual parts are made partial assembly begins,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;18;The reeds are riveted or screwed to an aluminum alloy reed plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;19;This plate has two slots and the reeds are attached over each on opposite sides,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;20;On the open end of each slot a leather or plastic valve is secured,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;21;The reed plates are then arranged in a specific order and attached to a wooden reed block,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;22;Depending on the model three or four of these blocks are put in the treble and bass side casings,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;23;The treble keyboard is attached to the reed block and the bass side buttons and keyboards are also attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;24;The bellows is typically supplied by outside manufacturers,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;25;It is made by folding and pleating strong cardboard and reinforcing it with leather and steel strips,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;26;The treble and bass casings are attached to it and sealed with wax to prevent air leakage,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;27;After the main parts have been assembled various decorative finishing touches are put on the accordion,Relevant
MadeHow;Accordion;28;For example the instrument is painted the treble grill is attached and the manufacturers name is added,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Accordion;29;The accordion is then put in its case packaged and shipped to distributors for sale,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;1;Sculpted acrylic nails are not manufactured on an assembly line by a machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;2;Instead as the name implies they are sculpted by a nail technician,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;3;Each handcrafted nail is formed one at a time using a process which consists of the following steps cleansing priming mixing sculpting and finishing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;4;Before the new nail can be sculpted the natural nail must be properly prepared,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;5;A nail bed cleanser is used to thoroughly clean the surface of the nail,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;6;These cleansers are typically solvents such as isopropyl alcohol which dissolve oils and grease from the surface of the nail,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;7;They will also remove bacteria from the area to help reduce the chance of infection,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;8;Care must be used when applying these solvents because they may dry out the skin surrounding the cuticle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;9;This occurs because the solvents also remove the skins own natural moisturizing oils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;10;After the nail bed has been cleansed a primer is applied to the nail bed to make sure the acrylic will adhere properly,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;11;Primers are available in two types nonetching and etching,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;12;The nonetching type works like doublesided tape one side of the primer is very good at sticking to the natural nail and the other end is equally attracted to the acrylic polymers used in the artificial nail,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;13;The etching type of primers are acids such as methacrylic acid which actually dissolve a thin layer of the nail itself,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;14;This etching process allows the acrylic to adhere to the nail better,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;15;The etching primers are more commonly used than nonetching,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;16;There is some debate regarding the proper use of etching primers some chemists argue that the primer should dry thoroughly before applying the acrylic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;17;Others believe that the acrylic should be applied while the primer is still wet to pull the acrylic deeper into the nail and anchor it more firmly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;18;The resin is made when the acrylic liquid is mixed with the acrylic powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;19;The nail technician must work quickly with the resin once the liquid and powder are mixed,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;20;If not the resin will harden before it can shaped into a nail and will not be useable,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;21;Before the resin is applied a nailshaped form is placed over each fingertip in order to hold the resin in place and ensure it takes the correct size and shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;22;These forms may be made of metalized foil or plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;23;One common type consists of a thin metallic foil with an adhesive backing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;24;The form is peeled off a roll (like a label) and carefully affixed to the fingers,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;25;The technician then applies the resin to the clients fingertips,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;26;The resin is sculpted to look as natural as possible before the resin hardens,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;27;The form is then removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;28;After the acrylic dries the new nail is filed and manicured to shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;29;Finally coatings and polishes are used to complete the manicure,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;30;As the natural nail grows further application of the liquid plastic is needed for the acrylic nail to maintain a regular contour,Relevant
MadeHow;Acrylic Fingernail;31;In some cases an acetate tip is also applied to the end of the nail to provide a stronger base for the layers of acrylic resin,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;1;Most air conditioners start out as raw material in the form of structural steel shapes and sheet steel,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Air Conditioner;3;The encasements or wrappers the metal that envelopes most outdoor residential units is made of galvanized sheet metal that uses a zinc coating to provide protection against corrosion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;4;Galvanized sheet metal is also used to form the bottom pan face plates and various support brackets throughout an air conditioner,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;5;This sheet metal is sheared on a shear press in a fabrication cell soon after arriving from storage or inventory,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;6;Structural steel shapes are cut and mitered on a band saw to form useful brackets and supports,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;7;From the shear press the sheet metal is loaded on a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) punch press,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;8;The punch press has the option of receiving its computer program from a drafting CADCAM (Computer Aided DraftingComputer Aided Manufacturing) program or from an independently written CNC program,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;9;The CADCAM program will transform a drafted or modeled part on the computer into a file that can be read by the punch press telling it where to punch holes in the sheet metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;10;Dies and other punching instruments are stored in the machine and mechanically brought to the punching arm where it can be used to drive through the sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;11;The NC (Numerically Controlled) press brakes bend the sheet into its final form using a computer file to program itself,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;12;Different bending dies are used for different shapes and configurations and may be changed for each component,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;13;Some brackets fins and sheet components are outsourced to other facilities or companies to produce large quantities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;14;They are brought to the assembly plant only when needed for assembly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;15;Many of the brackets are produced on a hydraulic or mechanical press where brackets of different shapes and configurations can be produced from a coiled sheet and unrolled continuously into the machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;16;High volumes of parts can be produced because the press can often produce a complex shape with one hit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;17;All parts must be completely clean and free of dirt oil grease and lubricants before they are powder coated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;18;Various cleaning methods are used to accomplish this necessary task,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;19;Large solution tanks filled with a cleaning solvent agitate and knock off the oil when parts are submersed,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;20;Spray wash systems use pressurized cleaning solutions to knock off dirt and grease,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;21;Vapor degreasing suspending the parts above a harsh cleansing vapor uses an acid solution and will leave the parts free of petroleum products,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;22;Most outsourced parts that arrive from a vendor have already been degreased and cleaned,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;23;For additional corrosion protection many parts will be primed in a phosphate primer bath before entering a drying oven to prepare them for the application of the powder coating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;24;Before brackets pans and wrappers are assembled together they are fed through a powder coating operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;25;The powder coating system sprays a paintlike dry powder onto the parts as they are fed through a booth on an overhead conveyor,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;26;This can be done by robotic sprayers that are programmed where to spray as each part feeds through the booth on the conveyor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;27;The parts are statically charged to attract the powder to adhere to deep crevices and bends within each part,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;28;The powdercoated parts are then fed through an oven usually with the same conveyor system where the powder is permanently baked onto the metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;29;The process takes less than 10 minutes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;30;The condenser and evaporator both act as a heat exchanger in air conditioning systems and are made of copper or aluminum tubing bent around in coil form to maximize the distance through which the working fluid travels,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;31;The opposing fluid or cooling fluid passes around the tubes as the working fluid draws away its heat in the evaporator,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;32;This is accomplished by taking many small diameter copper tubes bent in the same shape and anchoring them with guide rods and aluminum plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;33;The working fluid or refrigerant flows through the copper tubes and the opposing fluid flows around them in between the aluminum plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;34;The tubes will often end up with hairpin bends performed by NC benders using the same principle as the NC press brake,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;35;Each bend is identical to the next,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;36;The benders use previously straightened tubing to bend around a fixed die with a mandrel fed through the inner diameter to keep it from collapsing during the bend,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;37;The mandrel is raked back through the inside of the tube when the bend has been accomplished,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;38;Tubing supplied to the manufacturer in a coil form goes through an uncoiler and straightener before being fed through the bender,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;39;Some tubing will be cut into desired lengths on an abrasive saw that will cut several small tubes in one stroke,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;40;The aluminum plates are punched out on a punch press and formed on a mechanical press to place divots or waves in the plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;41;These waves maximize the thermodynamic heat transfer between the working fluid and the opposing medium,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;42;When the copper tubes are finished in the bending cell they are transported by automatic guided vehicle (AGV) to the assembly cell where they are stacked on the guide rods and fed through the plates or fins,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;43;A major part of the assembly is the joining of the copper tubing with the aluminum plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;44;This assembly becomes the evaporator and is accomplished by taking the stacked copper tubing in their hairpin configuration and mechanically fusing them to the aluminum plates,Relevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;45;The fusing occurs by taking a bullet or mandrel and feeding it through the copper tubing to expand it and push it against the inner part of the hole of the plate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;46;This provides a thrifty yet useful bond between the tubing and plate allowing for heat transfer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;47;The condenser is manufactured in a similar manner except that the opposing medium is usually air which cools off the copper or aluminum condenser coils without the plates,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Air Conditioner;48;They are held by brackets which support the coiled tubing and are connected to the evaporator with fittings or couplings,Relevant

MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;1;The following description applies generically to reusable hard tags details may vary among manufacturers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;2;Disposable security tags are manufactured in a similar manner except that the resonator is sealed inside a flexible plastic envelope which may be backed with adhesive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;3;The plastic casing for the tag is vacuum formed or injection molded,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;4;In the former process plastic that has been softened by heat is drawn into a mold by creation of a vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;5;In the latter semimolten plastic is squirted under pressure into a cooled mold where it hardens quickly,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;6;There are several ways a resonator can be made,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;7;One technique involves laminating copper or aluminum coils onto a web of nonconductive material,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;8;This is done by passing the adhesivecoated base web between rollers that apply a spiralshaped mask of nonsticky material after which the web passes through a dryer to set the mask,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;9;A thin flat strip of metal is then laminated to the uncoated (sticky) portion of the base web,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;10;The laminated strip subsequently passes between a backup roller and a cutting roller which cuts through the metal but not the base web disconnecting the individual metal coils from one another,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;11;This masking and laminating process is repeated adding a layer of web with metal spirals atop the first layer so that the two layers of spirals are face to face separated by a layer of dielectric (nonconductive) material,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;12;Finally the laminated strip is cut into individual resonators that can be inserted into security tags,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;13;Another type of resonator is made by winding insulated (encased in plastic) copper wire into a flat spiral of about a dozen loops with the ends of the wire connected through a diode,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;14;One company makes a buttonshaped tag that can operate with a very smalldiameter coil because the wire is spiraled into a cone shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;15;After the resonator is inserted into the security tags plastic casing the locking mechanism is installed,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;16;This usually consists of a clutch that will accept and lock a metal pin that can be inserted through a product at the retail store,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;17;There are numerous designs of clutches but one example is a metal plate with a small hole in the middle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;18;The hole is too small for the pins shaft to pass through unless the metal plate is flexed to enlarge the hole,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;19;Once the pin is inserted the plate flattens and the minimized hole fits around a grooved section in the shaft of the pin,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;20;To release this grip the sales clerk inserts the tag into a magnetic device that flexes the clutch plate allowing the pin to slide free,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;21;Another example of a clutch type is a ring of tiny balls that encircle the pin with a spring mechanism pressing the balls into a groove in the pins shaft a magnetic deactivator retracts the balls from the groove releasing the pin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;22;Still other tag designs use a mechanical deactivator that inserts a probe into the tag to physically disengage a locking device,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;23;With the resonator and clutch assemblies in place the upper and lower portions of the plastic tag casing are attached together,Relevant
MadeHow;Antishoplifting Tag;24;They are sealed by heat or welded by ultrasound,Relevant

MadeHow;Artificial Eye;12;Typically iris diameters range from 04052 in (1013 mm),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;13;The iris is painted on the back flat side of the button and checked against the patients iris by simply reversing the buttons so that the color can be seen through the dome of plastic,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;14;When the color is finished the ocularist removes the conformer which prevents contraction of the eye socket,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;15;Next the ocularist hand carves a wax molding shell,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;16;This shell has an aluminum iris button imbedded in it that duplicates the painted iris button,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;17;The wax shell is fitted into the patients socket so that it matches the irregular periphery of the socket,Relevant

MadeHow;Artificial Eye;31;The aluminum iris button has left a hole in the plaster mold into which the painted iris button is placed,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;32;White plastic is then put into the cast the two halves of the cast are put back together and then placed under pressure and plunged into boiling water,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;33;This reduces the water temperature and the plastic is thus cured under pressure for about 23 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;34;The cast is then removed from the water and cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;35;The plastic has hardened in the shape of the mold with the painted iris button imbedded in the proper place,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;36;About 05 mm of plastic is then removed from the anterior surface of the prosthesis,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;37;The white plastic which overlaps the iris button is ground down evenly around the edge of the button,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;38;This simulates how the sclera of the living eye slightly overlaps the iris,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;39;The sclera is colored using paints chalk pencils colored thread and a liquid plastic syrup to match the patients remaining eye,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;40;Any necessary alterations to the iris color can also be made at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;41;The prosthesis is then returned to the cast,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;42;Clear plastic is placed in the anterior half of the cast and the two halves are again joined placed under pressure and returned to the hot water,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;43;The final processing time is about 30 minutes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;44;The cast is then removed and cooled and the finished prosthesis is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Artificial Eye;45;Grinding and polishing the prosthesis to a high luster is the final step,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Aspartame;1;Although its components—aspartic acid phenylalanine and methanol—occur naturally in foods aspartame itself does not and must be manufactured,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;2;NutraSweet (aspartame) is made through fermentation and synthesis processes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;3;Direct fermentation produces the starting amino acids needed for the manufacture of aspartame,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;4;In this process specific types of bacteria which have the ability to produce certain amino acids are raised in large quantities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;5;Over the course of about three days the amino acids are harvested and the bacteria are destroyed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;6;To start the fermentation process a sample from a pure culture of bacteria is put into a test tube containing the nutrients necessary for its growth,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;7;After this initial inoculation the bacteria begin to multiply,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;8;When their population is large enough they are transferred to a seed tank,Relevant

MadeHow;Aspartame;10;The seed tank provides an ideal environment for growing more bacteria,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;11;It is filled with the things bacteria need to thrive including warm water and carbohydrate foods like cane molasses glucose or sucrose,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;12;It also has carbon sources like acetic acid alcohols or hydrocarbons and nitrogen sources such as liquid ammonia or urea,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;13;These are required for the bacteria to synthesize large quantities of the desired amino acid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;14;Other growth factors such as vitamins amino acids and minor nutrients round out seed tank contents,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;15;The seed tank is equipped with a mixer which keeps the growth medium moving and a pump which delivers filtered compressed air,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Aspartame;19;Here the bacteria are allowed to grow and produce large quantities of amino acids,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;20;Since pH control is vital for optimal growth ammonia water is added to the tank as necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;21;When enough amino acid is present the contents of the fermentation tank are transferred out so isolation can begin,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;22;This process starts with a centrifugal separator which isolates a large portion of the bacterial amino acids,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;23;The desired amino acid is further segregated and purified in an ionexchange column,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;24;From this column the amino acids are pumped to a crystallizing tank and then to a crystal separator,Relevant

MadeHow;Aspartame;26;Aspartame can be made by various synthetic chemical pathways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;27;In general phenylalanine is modified by a reaction with methanol and then combined with a slightly modified aspartic acid which eventually forms aspartame,Relevant

MadeHow;Aspartame;31;One method is by reacting the aspartic acid with substances that result in added benzyl rings to protect these sites,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;32;This ensures that further chemical reactions will occur only on specific parts of the aspartic acid molecule,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;33;After the amino acids are appropriately modified they are pumped into a reactor tank where they are allowed to mix at room temperature for 24 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;34;The temperature is then increased to approximately 149°F (65 °C) and maintained for another 24 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;35;The reaction is then cooled to room temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;36;It is diluted with an appropriate solvent and cooled to about 0°F (18°C) causing crystallization,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;37;The crystals are then isolated by filtration and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;38;These crystals are an intermediate of aspartame which must be further modified,Relevant
MadeHow;Aspartame;39;The intermediate is converted to aspartame by reacting it with acetic acid,Relevant

MadeHow;Clarinet;1;When wood is harvested for clarinetmaking logs are sawed to between 34 ft (112 m) in length,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;2;The logs must be seasoned to prevent later warping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;3;They may be seasoned by being kept in the open air for several months or they may be dried in a kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;4;Then the logs are split and sawed to lengths approximating the finished lengths of the clarinet body pieces (upper and lower joints barrel and bell),Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;5;The body pieces look like narrow rectangular blocks and pieces for the barrel are carved in a rough pyramidal shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;6;These pieces are known as billets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;7;The manufacturer buys the billets in lots and begins the manufacturing process from these roughedout shapes,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;8;When the manufacturer receives the billets workers inspect the lot,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;9;Then skilled workers place the billets on a borer which drills a hole lengthwise through the center of each piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;10;The diameter and shape of this hole called the bore of the clarinet is crucial to determining the tone of the instrument,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;11;The bore may be drilled in a straight cylinder or the cylinder may be slightly tapered,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;12;After the bore is drilled the body pieces are turned on a lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;13;The rectangular billets become smooth round hollow cylinders,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Clarinet;18;The bore may be reamed more precisely and then it is polished on the inside,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;19;Then the joints are painted with a black dye,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;20;Body parts for clarinets made of plastic are produced by injection molding,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;21;Plastic pellets are melted and forced under pressure into molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;22;The molds for clarinet body parts produce hollow cylinders,Relevant

MadeHow;Clarinet;24;Or they may be reamed and polished as are wooden clarinets,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;25;The steps that follow apply to both wooden and plastic models,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;26;Next the maker bores the tone holes that the players fingers cover to make the different notes,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;27;The most common method for massproduced clarinets is to set the body pieces in a setting out machine,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;28;This is a table which holds the piece on a mount under a vertical drill,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;29;The holes are drilled at specified distances apart and with precise diameters,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;30;The exact dimension of the holes affects the tuning of the instrument and the holes may be adjusted after the instrument is nearly complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;31;Not every hole is the same size and the maker may have to insert a different drill bit for each hole,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;32;The holes are smaller on the outside than on the inside and to achieve their precise shape after the holes are drilled they are undercut,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;33;The clarinet maker uses a small flared tool placed in the tone hole to expand the underside of the hole,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;34;Next to the tone holes tiny holes for holding the key mechanism are also drilled,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;35;Early clarinets were made with handforged keys,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Clarinet;45;There are two main clarinet key systems in use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;46;The simple or Albert system is used principally in Germanspeaking countries,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;47;The Bohm system has more keys than the Albert and is standard in most other parts of the world,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;48;The keys are then fitted with pads,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;49;The pads are usually made of several layers—cardboard felt and skin or leather,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;50;The circular pads are stamped or cut and then workers glue them by hand into the head of the key,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;51;This will muffle the sound of the tone hole closing when the instrument is played,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;52;The keys are drilled and then fitted with springs that will keep them either open or closed,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;53;These springs are made of fine steel wire,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;54;The keys are mounted on small pillars called posts,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;55;The posts are first set in the holes previously drilled for them,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;56;In many models the posts are threaded and they can be simply screwed in by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;57;Using a very small drill bit tiny holes are then drilled in the posts to hold the needle springs,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;58;Then the keys are screwed into the posts with stainless steel hinge rods,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;59;The assembler uses a fine screwdriver pliers and a small leather mallet to fit the keys and adjust the spring action,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;60;The assembler also checks that the tone holes are covered completely by the key pad inserting a tiny pick under the pad on each side,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;61;The pad may need to be adjusted or reset or the assembler may clamp a key shut temporarily to set the crease for a perfect airtight closure,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;62;The joints of the body pieces are lined with cork and waxed so that the pieces fit smoothly into each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Clarinet;63;The ends of the body pieces are fitted with decorative metal rings as is the bottom of the barrel,Relevant

MadeHow;Concrete Block;1;The production of concrete blocks consists of four basic processes mixing molding curing and cubing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;2;Some manufacturing plants produce only concrete blocks while others may produce a wide variety of precast concrete products including blocks flat paver stones and decorative landscaping pieces such as lawn edging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;3;Some plants are capable of producing 2000 or more blocks per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;4;The following steps are commonly used to manufacture concrete blocks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;5;The sand and gravel are stored outside in piles and are transferred into storage bins in the plant by a conveyor belt as they are needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;6;The portland cement is stored outside in large vertical silos to protect it from moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;7;As a production run starts the required amounts of sand gravel and cement are transferred by gravity or by mechanical means to a weigh batcher which measures the proper amounts of each material,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;8;The dry materials then flow into a stationary mixer where they are blended together for several minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;9;There are two types of mixers commonly used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;10;One type called a planetary or pan mixer resembles a shallow pan with a lid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;11;Mixing blades are attached to a vertical rotating shaft inside the mixer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;12;The other type is called a horizontal drum mixer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;13;It resembles a coffee can turned on its side and has mixing blades attached to a horizontal rotating shaft inside the mixer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;14;After the dry materials are blended a small amount of water is added to the mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;15;If the plant is located in a climate subject to temperature extremes the water may first pass through a heater or chiller to regulate its temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;16;Admixture chemicals and coloring pigments may also be added at this time,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;17;The concrete is then mixed for six to eight minutes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;18;Once the load of concrete is thoroughly mixed it is dumped into an inclined Concrete Blockbucket conveyor and transported to an elevated hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;19;The mixing cycle begins again for the next load,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;20;From the hopper the concrete is conveyed to another hopper on top of the block machine at a measured flow rate,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;21;In the block machine the concrete is forced downward into molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;22;The molds consist of an outer mold box containing several mold liners,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;23;The liners determine the outer shape of the block and the inner shape of the block cavities,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;24;As many as 15 blocks may be molded at one time,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;25;When the molds are full the concrete is compacted by the weight of the upper mold head coming down on the mold cavities,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;26;This compaction may be supplemented by air or hydraulic pressure cylinders acting on the mold head,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;27;Most block machines also use a short burst of mechanical vibration to further aid compaction,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;28;The compacted blocks are pushed down and out of the molds onto a flat steel pallet,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;29;The pallet and blocks are pushed out of the machine and onto a chain conveyor,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;30;In some operations the blocks then pass under a rotating brush which removes loose material from the top of the blocks,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;31;The pallets of blocks are conveyed to an automated stacker or loader which places them in a curing rack,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;32;Each rack holds several hundred blocks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;33;When a rack is full it is rolled onto a set of rails and moved into a curing kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;34;The kiln is an enclosed room with the capacity to hold several racks of blocks at a time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;35;There are two basic types of curing kilns,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;36;The most common type is a lowpressure steam kiln,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;37;In this type the blocks are held in the kiln for one to three hours at room temperature to allow them to harden slightly,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;38;Steam is then gradually introduced to raise the temperature at a controlled rate of not more than 60°F per hour (16°C per hour),Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;39;Standard weight blocks are usually cured at a temperature of 150165°F (6674°C) while lightweight blocks are cured at 170185°F (7785°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;40;When the curing temperature has been reached the steam is shut off and the blocks are allowed to soak in the hot moist air for 1218 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;41;After soaking the blocks are dried by exhausting the moist air and further raising the temperature in the kiln,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;42;The whole curing cycle takes about 24 hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;43;Another type of kiln is the highpressure steam kiln sometimes called an autoclave,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;44;In this type the temperature is raised to 300375°F (149191°C) and the pressure is raised to 80185 psi (5445358 bar),Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;45;The blocks are allowed to soak for five to 10 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;46;The pressure is then rapidly vented which causes the blocks to quickly release their trapped moisture,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;47;The autoclave curing process requires more energy and a more expensive kiln but it can produce blocks in less time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;48;The racks of cured blocks are rolled out of the kiln and the pallets of blocks are unstacked and placed on a chain conveyor,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;49;The blocks are pushed off the steel pallets and the empty pallets are fed back into the block machine to receive a new set of molded blocks,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;50;If the blocks are to be made into splitface blocks they are first molded as two blocks joined together,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;51;Once these double blocks are cured they pass through a splitter which strikes them with a heavy blade along the section between the two halves,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;52;This causes the double block to fracture and form a rough stonelike texture on one face of each piece,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;53;The blocks pass through a cuber which aligns each block and then stacks them into a cube three blocks across by six blocks deep by three or four blocks high,Relevant
MadeHow;Concrete Block;54;These cubes are carried outside with a forklift and placed in storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;1;The irritant that is surgically implanted in an oyster as the nucleus of the pearl is made from the shell of a mussel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;2;As many as ten different mussel species including the American pigtoe mussel and the washboard mussel are used because their shells are as much as an inch thick near the hinge,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;3;Twenty of these beads or nuclei called kaku in Japanese can be carved from one mussel shell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;4;In a cultured pearl this nucleus is the major portion of the pearl because the pearl coating is relatively thin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;5;Many of the nuclei are manufactured in Tennessee where the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers host the source mussels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;6;Baby oysters called spat are born in hatcheries and grown in tanks at the pearl farms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;7;They are matured in baskets in ocean waters (maricultured) after they are 60 days old and after they have grown stronger after spending three years in the water they are large enough to withstand removal and implanting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;8;To implant the nuclei harvested oysters are taken inside pearl farm operating rooms and held together on racks,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;9;When each is removed from the crowd its shell opens slightly a wedge is inserted so the shell stays open and an operator opens the shell wider to insert the bead,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;10;A cut is made in the oysters body and the nucleus is inserted along with a tiny cutting of the mantle of another oyster that is sacrificed for the process,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;11;The mantle insert stimulates the production of nacre which is excreted by the mantle of the host animal,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;12;The oysters are then returned to the water by stringing them on plastic garlands or placing them in oyster baskets suspended from rafts,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;13;While the oysters are in the water the pearl exterior forms over time and fluctuates with water temperature and other conditions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;14;A porous layer called the conchiolin forms around the nucleus and under the nacre,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;15;The nacre consists of microlayers of a specialized form of the mineral calcium carbonate called aragonite,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;16;The layers are composed of microscopic plates that make cultured pearls feel rough when they are rubbed against the teeth—a test to distinguish simulated or imitation pearls from natural and cultured gems,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;17;The oysters are harvested some time later (depending on the desired finished diameter of the pearl) in winter when cold water slows nacre production and also creates the best color luster and orient which is the ability of the pearl to reflect light,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;18;The time of culturing typically ranges from one to three years and the progress of pearl growth inside the oysters can be monitored with x rays,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;19;The pearls are carefully cut out of the oysters flesh at the pearl farm and productive oysters can be reseeded several times to produce larger pearls as the oysters continue to grow,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;20;The extracted pearls are processed for sale,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;21;Typically the better specimens of pearls are sold in bulk at auctions regulated by governments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;22;From auctions the pearls move to dealers then jewelers,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;23;The pearl farm may also drill and string its pearls for sale,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;24;Jewelry fasteners are usually added at another factory,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;25;Design of pearls seems an unlikely possibility but in fact a wide variety of colors and shapes exist even through they are extensions of the natural process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;26;The Chinese began pearl design in the twelfth century by cementing tiny Buddhas carved from wood stone or ivory or cast from metal inside the shells of freshwater mussels,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;27;The Buddhas became coated with nacre or pearlized and were a successful product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;28;This practice still thrives in Chinese pearl culturing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;29;The same general technique is used to make halfpearls called mabes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;30;A molded or cut half shape is planted against the oysters shell after it becomes coated and is removed the halfpearl can be mounted on a jewelry backing like an earring,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;31;In color Japanese pearls range naturally from pink to blue to greenish yellow,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;32;Pearls are bleached to lighten these colors and eliminate any surface staining,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;33;Colored pearls are made by injecting dye into the porous conchiolin and the pearl must be drilled to be dyed,Relevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;34;The most exotic designer pearls are probably the large black pearls cultured in Australia and the South Seas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;35;They are grown in the largest pearl oysters in the world and a perfect specimen of black pearl can sell in the United States for $40000,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;36;Black pearls also display a natural range of colors from silver to green pearls called peacocks—and white,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;37;Shape is also designed not only by creating pearlized molds but through culturing of Cultured Pearlfreshwater pearls,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;38;These come in irregular shapes determined by the piece of mantle inserted to stimulate growth of a pearl,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Cultured Pearl;39;Human intervention is visible in these designs because the implanters skill influences the shape of the resulting pearl,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;1;The production of a dental drill is an integrated process in which individual components are first made and then assembled to make the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;2;While manufacturers could make each part individually they usually depend on outside suppliers for many of the parts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;3;A typical production method would include constructing the motors and the drill bits forming the handpiece final assembly and packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;4;Although numerous designs and materials are used to make the handpiece they are all typically made using a preformed mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;5;For plastic handpieces this involves injection molding a process in which the plastic is melted injected into a mold and released after it forms,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;6;Metal handpieces also use a similar molding process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;7;The drill bits are formed from tungsten carbide particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;8;They are made by first taking tungsten ore and chemically processing it to produce tungsten oxides,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;9;Hydrogen is then added to the system to remove the oxygen resulting in a fine tungsten metal powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;10;This powder is then blended with carbon and heated producing tungsten carbide particles of varying sizes,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;11;These particles are further processed to form the appropriately shaped drill bit,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;12;The air turbine engine is constructed from small steel components,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;13;In one design the turbine is sandwiched between two sets of ball raced bearings and connected directly to the drill bit,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;14;The entire unit is encased in the drill head with openings for incoming air and exhaust air,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;15;Other types of turbine engines are farther up in the handpiece and are connected to the drill bit by a series of driveshafts and gears,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;16;The lowpowered motors are put together much like the air turbine engines,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;17;The rotary vane airpowered motor consists of a core structure with sliding vanes protruding outward,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;18;It is placed in the handpiece and connected to the main driveshaft of the drill,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;19;It also has an opening for incoming and outgoing air,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;20;Electric motors are significantly Dental Drillmore complex consisting of a set of bearings magnets brushes and armature coils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;21;After all the components are available final assembly can begin,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;22;Depending on the design the air turbine can be placed directly into casing of the handpiece or it can be attached along with the drill bit,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;23;The other parts of the drill are put into the handpiece including air or electric motors driveshaft gears and control switches,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;24;Other accessories are added such as the cooling hoses and fiber optic lighting devices,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;25;The coupler is placed on one end of the handpiece and the drill bit is attached to the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Dental Drill;26;After an array of quality checks the finished drills are placed in the appropriate packaging along with accessories manuals and replacement parts and are then shipped to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;1;The manufacturing process begins with a preliminary impression of the patients mouth which is usually done in wax,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;2;This impression is used to prepare a diagnostic cast,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;3;While making the impression the dentist applies pressure to the soft tissues to simulate biting force and extends the borders of the mold to adjacent toothless areas to allow the dentures to better adapt to the gums,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;4;Once an appropriate preliminary cast has been obtained the final cast is cast from gypsum a stonelike product,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;5;The final mold is inspected and approved before using it to manufacture the teeth,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;6;After the mold has been cast it is filled with acrylic resin to form the denture,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;7;The mold is prepared with a release agent prior to adding the resin to ensure that the hardened acrylic can be easily removed once the process is completed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;8;A sheet of separating film between the acrylic and the model is also helpful in this regard,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;9;The denturist then mixes the appropriate resin compounds in liquid form,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;10;Upon drying the resin hardens to a durable finish,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;11;This resin mixture is packed into the mold while a vertical vise packs it tightly,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;12;At this point the model can be inspected to ensure it is filled properly and if necessary additional resin can be added,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;13;Instead of vice packing certain types of acrylic may be poured into the mold,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;14;This method is more prone to air bubbles than hand packing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;15;Once the mold is packed to the denturists satisfaction it is heated to initiate the chemical reaction which causes the resin to harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;16;This part of the process may take up to eight hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;17;After the heating is done and the mold has cooled the mold is broken apart so the denture may be removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;18;The denture is then put in the model of the patients mouth to ensure that it fits and that the bite is good,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;19;Because of the number of processing steps there may be a slight discrepancy in the fit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;20;Usually just a minor grinding and smoothing of surfaces is all that is necessary to make the denture fit correctly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Denture;21;At this point if the denture is the removable type it is ready for use,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;22;Implants require additional preparatory steps before they can be used,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;23;The denturist must drill the appropriate holes in the jaw bone and attach an anchor,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;24;After three to six months when the hole has healed and the anchor is set in place a small second surgical procedure is necessary to expose the implant and connect a metal rod to it that will be used to hold the crown or bridge,Relevant
MadeHow;Denture;25;Finally the replacement tooth is attached to the rod where it is held firmly in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;1;The absorbent pad is formed on a movable conveyer belt that passes through a long forming chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;2;At various points in the chamber pressurized nozzles spray either polymer particles or fibrous material onto the conveyor surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;3;The bottom of the conveyor is perforated and as the pad material is sprayed onto the belt a vacuum is applied from below so that the fibers are pulled down to form a flat pad,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;4;At least two methods have been employed to incorporate absorbent polymers into the pad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;5;In one method the polymer is injected into the same feed stock that supplies the fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;6;This method produces a pad that has absorbent polymer dispersed evenly throughout its entire length width and thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;7;The problems associated with method are that loss of absorbent may occur because the fine particles are pulled through the perforations in the conveyor by the vacuum,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;8;It is therefore expensive and messy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;9;This method also causes the pad to absorb unevenly since absorbent is lost from only one side and not the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;10;A second method of applying polymer and fiber involves application of the absorbent material onto the top surface of the pad after it has been formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;11;This method produces a pad which has absorbent material concentrated on its top side and does not have much absorbency throughout the pad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;12;Another disadvantage is that a pad made in Disposable Diaperthis way may lose some of the polymer applied to its surface,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;13;Furthermore this approach tends to cause gel blocking since all the absorbent is on the outside of the pad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;14;The moisture gets trapped in this outer layer and does not have a chance to diffuse to the center,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;15;This blockage holds moisture against the skin and can lead to discomfort for the wearer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;16;These problems are solved by controlling the mixture polymer and fibrous material,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;17;Multiple spray dispensers are used to apply several layers of polymer and fiber,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;18;As the fiber is drawn into the chamber and the bottom of the pad is formed a portion of the polymer is added to the mix to form a layer of combined polymer and fiber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;19;Then more pure fiber is pulled on top to give a sandwich effect,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;20;This formation creates a pad with the absorbent polymer confined to its center surrounded by fibrous material,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;21;Gel blockage is not a problem because the polymer is concentrated at core of pad,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;22;It also solves the problem of particle loss since all the absorbent is surrounded by fibrous material,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;23;Finally this process is more cost effective because it distributes the polymer just where it is needed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;24;After the pad has received a full dose of fiber and polymer it proceeds down the conveyor path to a leveling roller near the outlet of the forming chamber,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;25;This roller removes a portion of the fiber at the top of the pad to make it a uniform thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;26;The pad then moves by the conveyor through the outlet for subsequent operations to form the competed diaper,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;27;Sheets of nonwoven fabric are formed from plastic resin using the meltblown process as described above,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;28;These sheets are produced as a wide roll known as a web which is then cut to the appropriate width for use in diapers,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;29;There is a web for the top sheet and another for the bottom sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;30;It should be noted that this step does not necessarily occur in sequence after pad formation because the nonwoven fabrics are often made in a separate location,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;31;When the manufacturer is ready to initiate diaper production these large bolts of fabric are connected to special roller equipment that feeds fabric to the assembly line,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;32;At some point in the process stretched elastic bands are attached to the backing sheet with adhesive,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;33;After the diaper is assembled these elastic bands contract and gather the diaper together to ensure a snug fit and limit leakage,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;34;At this point in the process there are still three separate components the absorbent pad the top sheet and the backing sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;35;These three components are in long strips and must be joined together and cut into diapersized units,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;36;This is accomplished by feeding the absorbent pad onto a conveyor with the polyethylene bottom sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;37;The polypropylene top sheet is then fed into place and the compiled sheets are joined by gluing heating or ultrasonic welding,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;38;The assembled diaper may have other attachments such as strips of tape or Velcro ™ which act as closures,Relevant
MadeHow;Disposable Diaper;39;The long roll is then cut into individual diapers folded and packaged for shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;1;The components of an EKG machine are typically manufactured separately and then assembled prior to packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;2;These components including the electrodes the amplifier and the output device can be supplied by outside manufacturers or made inhouse,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;3;The most common electrode used for an EKG machine is the silver and silver chloride electrode because the electrode potential of these electrodes is stable when exposed to biological tissue,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;4;The electrodes are received from outside suppliers and checked to see if they conform to set specifications,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;5;The type of electrode used depends on the EKG model,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;6;Often multiple types of electrodes will be supplied with one EKG machine,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;7;Each electrode contains a shielded cable that can be attached to the primary unit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;8;The electronic components of an EKG device are quite sophisticated and use the latest in electronic processing technology,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;9;The amplifier and output device are assembled much like that of other electronic equipment,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;10;It begins with a board that has the electronic configuration mapped out,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;11;This board is then passed through a series of machines which place the appropriate chips diodes capacitors and other electronic pieces in the appropriate places,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;12;When completed it is sent to the next step for soldering,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;13;The electronic components are affixed to the board by a wave soldering machine,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;14;Boards that enter this machine are first washed to remove any contaminants,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;15;The board is then heated using infrared heat,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;16;The underside of the board is passed over a wave of molten solder which fills in the appropriate spots through capillary action,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;17;As the board is allowed to cool the solder hardens holding the pieces in place,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;18;Depending on the type of display device manufacture method differs,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;19;Certain devices such as magnetic tape recorders and paper printers can be supplied by outside manufacturers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;20;Other components like computer microprocessors can be designed and made right along with the primary internal electronics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;21;The components of the EKG machine are assembled and placed into an appropriate metal frame,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;22;The finished devices are then put into final packaging along with accessories such as spare electrodes printout paper and manuals,Relevant
MadeHow;EKG Machine;23;They are then sent out to distributors and finally to customers,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;1;The first stage of escalator construction is to establish the design as described above,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;2;The escalator manufacturer uses this information to construct the appropriately customized equipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;3;There are two types of companies that supply escalators primary manufacturers who actually build the equipment and secondary suppliers that design and install the equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;4;In most cases the secondary suppliers obtain the necessary equipment from the primary manufacturers and make necessary modifications for installation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;5;Therefore most escalators are actually assembled at the primary manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;6;The tracks step chains stair assembly and motorized gears and pulleys are all bolted into place on the truss before shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;7;Prior to installation the landing areas must be prepared to connect to the escalator,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;8;For example concrete fittings must be poured and the steel framework that will hold the truss in place must be attached,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;9;After the escalator is delivered the entire assembly is uncrated and jockeyed into position between the top and bottom landing holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;10;There are a variety of methods for lifting the truss assembly into place one of which is a scissors lift apparatus mounted on a wheeled support platform,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;11;The scissors lift is outfitted with a locator assembly to aid in vertical and angular alignment of the escalator,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;12;With such a device the upper end of the truss can be easily aligned with and then supported by a support wall associated with the upper landing,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;13;The lower end of the truss can be subsequently lowered into a pit associated with the floor of the lower landing,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;14;In some cases the railings may be shipped separately from the rest of the equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;15;In such a situation they are carefully coiled and packed for shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;16;They are then connected to the appropriate chains after the escalator is installed,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;17;Make final connections for the power source and check to ensure all tracks and chains are properly aligned,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;18;Verify all motorized elements are functioning properly that the belts and chains move smoothly and at the correct speed and that the emergency braking system is activated,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;19;The step treads must be far enough apart that they do not pinch or rub against each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;20;However they should be positioned such that no large gaps are present which could increase the chance of injury,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;21;An escalator is a continuously moving staircase,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Escalator;22;Each stair has a pair of wheels on each side one at the front of the step and one at the rear,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;23;The wheels run on two rails,Relevant
MadeHow;Escalator;24;At the top and bottom of the escalator the inner rail dips beneath the outer rail so that the bottom of the stair flattens making it easier for riders to get on and off,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;1;The production of a fake fur can be a mostly automated process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;2;The manufacturing steps involved include production of the synthetic fibers construction of the garment and modification of the garment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;3;Making a fake fur begins with the production of the synthetic fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;4;While different types of polymers are used modacrylic polymers provide a good illustration of the fiber manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;5;First the acrylonitrile and vinyl chloride monomers are mixed together in a large stainless steel container,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;6;They are forced into a chamber in which the pressure and temperature is increased,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;7;Mixing blades are constantly in motion and the polymerization process begins,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;8;A white powdery resin is produced which is then converted into a thick liquid by dissolving it in acetone,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;9;The liquid polymer mixture is then pumped through a filter to remove undissolved particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;10;From the filter the material is pumped through spinnerets which are submerged in a water bath,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;11;The spinnerets look similar to shower heads and when the polymer is extruded through it emerges as a group of continuous fibers called a tow,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;12;The tow is then pulled along a conveyor belt and stretched through a series of pulleys,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;13;As the tow is stretched it is also washed and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;14;As it dries the acetone is driven off leaving only the polymer,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;15;The continuous fibers are then annealed making them stronger and are sent to a machine that cuts them to appropriate sizes,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;16;After various quality control checks are performed on the fibers they are moved to the next phase of processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;17;Here the polymers are soaked in dye solutions and colored,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;18;While this is not the only phase of manufacture in which the fibers are colored this is usually the point where solid background colors are obtained,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;19;While the fibers provide the primary texture and look for imitation fur the backing provides most of the structure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;20;Working off a specific garment design the backing which is made out of cotton or wool is sent through a machine to be appropriately cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;21;It is then transferred to the next phase of production in which the fibers will be attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;22;To convert the fibers into a garment four different techniques can be employed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;23;The most basic method is the weaving process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;24;In this process the fibers are looped through and interlaced with the backing fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;25;While this technique is fairly slow it can produce a large range of cloth shapes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;26;Another method of fake fur production is called tufting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;27;It is similar to weaving however it produces garments at a much higher rate of speed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;28;Circular loop knitting and sliver knitting are other methods of fake fur garment production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;29;Sliver knitting utilizes the same equipment used in jersey knitting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;30;This makes it the fastest and most economical of all the fake fur garment production techniques and it is also the one most used by manufacturers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;31;To simulate a natural fur the garments are treated in various ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;32;First to ensure that the fake fur will remain unchanged after it is produced the fabric is heated,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;33;This heat setting process preshrinks the fabric giving it improved stability and expanded fiber diameters,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;34;Next to remove loose fibers from the fabric wire brushes are passed through the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;35;This process is known as tigering,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;36;Rough shearing of the fibers by cutting them with a set of helical knives gives Fake Furthem a uniform length,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;37;The luster of the fabric can be improved through a method known as electrofying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;38;This is a polishing technique that involves combing the fabric with a heated grooved cylinder in both directions,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;39;The next treatment is the application of chemicals such as resins and silicones which improves the feel and look of the fiber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;40;Coloring to simulate specific animals can also be enhanced at this staged,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;41;Another round of electrofying can be done as well as a finishing shearing to remove any remaining loose fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;42;Depending on the type of fake fur embossing to simulate curls can also be done during this stage of manufacture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;43;After the fake fur has been produced the government requires that they are labeled as imitation fur fabrics,Relevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;44;These labels are typically sewn in the inside of the garment and must be legible throughout the life of the product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fake Fur;45;In the final steps of fake fur manufacturing the garment is put in the appropriate packaging and shipped to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;1;Fully integrated factories have been designed to produce compound fertilizers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;2;Depending on the actual composition of the end product the production process will differ from manufacturer to manufacturer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;3;Ammonia is one nitrogen fertilizer component that can be synthesized from inexpensive raw materials,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;4;Since nitrogen makes up a significant portion of the earths atmosphere a process was developed to produce ammonia from air,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;5;In this process Fertilizernatural gas and steam are pumped into a large vessel,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;6;Next air is pumped into the system and oxygen is removed by the burning of natural gas and steam,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;7;This leaves primarily nitrogen hydrogen and carbon dioxide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;8;The carbon dioxide is removed and ammonia is produced by introducing an electric current into the system,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;9;Catalysts such as magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) have been used to improve the speed and efficiency of ammonia synthesis,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;10;Any impurities are removed from the ammonia and it is stored in tanks until it is further processed,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;11;While ammonia itself is sometimes used as a fertilizer it is often converted to other substances for ease of handling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;12;Nitric acid is produced by first mixing ammonia and air in a tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;13;In the presence of a catalyst a reaction occurs which converts the ammonia to nitric oxide,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;14;The nitric oxide is further reacted in the presence of water to produce nitric acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;15;Nitric acid and ammonia are used to make ammonium nitrate,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;16;This material is a good fertilizer component because it has a high concentration of nitrogen,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;17;The two materials are mixed together in a tank and a neutralization reaction occurs producing ammonium nitrate,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;18;This material can then be stored until it is ready to be granulated and blended with the other fertilizer components,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;19;To isolate phosphorus from phosphate rock it is treated with sulfuric acid producing phosphoric acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;20;Some of this material is reacted further with sulfuric acid and nitric acid to produce a triple superphosphate an excellent source of phosphorous in solid form,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;21;Some of the phosphoric acid is also reacted with ammonia in a separate tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;22;This reaction results in ammonium phosphate another good primary fertilizer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;23;Potassium chloride is typically supplied to fertilizer manufacturers in bulk,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;24;The manufacturer converts it into a more usable form by granulating it,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;25;This makes it easier to mix with other fertilizer components in the next step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;26;To produce fertilizer in the most usable form each of the different compounds ammonium nitrate potassium chloride ammonium phosphate and triple superphosphate are granulated and blended together,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;27;One method of granulation involves putting the solid materials into a rotating drum which has an inclined axis,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;28;As the drum rotates pieces of the solid fertilizer take on small spherical shapes,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;29;They are passed through a screen that separates out adequately sized particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;30;A coating of inert dust is then applied to the particles keeping each one discrete and inhibiting moisture retention,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;31;Finally the particles are dried completing the granulation process,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;32;The different types of particles are blended together in appropriate proportions to produce a composite fertilizer,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;33;The blending is done in a large mixing drum that rotates a specific number of turns to produce the best mixture possible,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;34;After mixing the fertilizer is emptied onto a conveyor belt which transports it to the bagging machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;35;Fertilizers are typically supplied to farmers in large bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;36;To fill these bags the fertilizer is first delivered into a large hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;37;An appropriate amount is released from the hopper into a bag that is held open by a clamping device,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;38;The bag is on a vibrating surface which allows better packing,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;39;When filling is complete the bag is transported upright to a machine that seals it closed,Relevant
MadeHow;Fertilizer;40;The bag is then conveyored to a palletizer which stacks multiple bags readying them for shipment to distributors and eventually to farmers,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;1;Advanced technology and processing have improved the quality of fiberboard,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;2;These include innovations in wood preparation resin recipes press technology and panel sanding techniques,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;3;Advanced press technology has shortened overall pressing cycles while antistatic technology has also contributed to increased belt life during the sanding process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;4;Producing quality fiberboard begins with the selection and refinement of the raw materials most of which are recycled from shavings and chips reclaimed from sawmills and plywood plants,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;5;The raw material is first removed of any metal impurities using a magnet,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;6;Next the material is separated into large chunks and small flakes,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;7;Flakes are separated into sawdust and wood chip piles,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;8;The material is sent through a magnetic detector again with the rejected material being separated for reuse as fuel,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;9;Good material is collected and sent into a presteaming bin,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;10;In the bin steam is injected to heat and soften the material,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;11;The fibers are fed first into a side screw feeder and then into a plug screw feeder which compresses the fibers and removes water,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;12;The compressed material is then fed into a refiner which tears the material into usable fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;13;Sometimes the fiber may undergo a second refining step in order to improve fiber purity,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;14;Larger motors on the refiners are sometimes used to sift out foreign objects from the process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;15;Resin is added before the refining step to control the formaldehyde tolerances in the mixture and after refining a catalyst is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;16;The fibers are then blown into a flash tube dryer which is heated by either oil or gas,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;17;The ratio of solid resin to fiber is carefully controlled by weighing each ingredient,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;18;Next the fiber is pushed through scalping rolls to produce a mat of uniform thickness,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;19;This mat goes through several pressing steps to produce a more usable size and then is trimmed to the desired width before the final pressing step,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;20;A continuous press equipped with a large drum compresses the mat at a uniform rate by monitoring the mat height,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;21;Presses are equipped with electronic controls to provide accurate density and strength,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;22;The resulting board is cut to the appropriate length using saws before cooling,Relevant
MadeHow;Fiberboard;23;Presses have counterbalanced simultaneous closing systems that use hydraulic cylinders to effect platen leveling which when operating in conjunction with a fourpoint position control gives greater individual panel thickness control,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;1;Raw coffee beans are processed in two primary ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;2;The dry method allows the beans to dry on the plant or be dehydrated by the sun after harvesting,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;3;The beans are then separated from the rest of the plant debris by milling,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;4;In the wet method the beans are steeped and fermented up to 24 hours then a water spray removes the pulp and the beans are dried in the sun or in tumble dryers,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;5;A hulling machine then removes the protective membrane around the bean,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;6;In both cases the beans are cleaned sorted and graded,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;7;Roasting develops the beans natural flavor by making the raw beans darker and bringing out the oils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;8;Green raw beans are roasted in ovens at a temperature between 380480°F (193249°C) for one to 17 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;9;The degree of roasting determines the depth of flavor—the darker the roast Flavored Coffee Beanthe heavier the flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;10;There are five commons roasts American Viennese Italian French Dark and Espresso Black,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;11;The American or Regular roast has light to medium brown beans with no oil on the bean,Relevant

MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;17;With its smoky roasty flavors it makes an authoritative coffee,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;18;Espresso Black is the highest roasting degree,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;19;This roast produces beans which are almost carbonized and it yields the strongest brew,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;20;If flavoring is added to beans which have too mild a roast the coffee lacks significant flavor characteristics and a flattasting beverage results,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;21;If the roast is too dark the added flavor is overshadowed by the taste of the beans,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;22;For example a French Vanilla flavor will be lost on a French Roast bean because the robust quality of the bean will overwhelm the sweet creamy tones of the flavor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;23;The perfect roast color for flavored coffee is medium to brown,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;24;After the beans are roasted they must be quickly cooled before flavorings can be added,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;25;Flavoring the beans while they are still at high temperatures can destroy some of the flavor compounds,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;26;In large commercial operations cooling is done by water quenching which is a quick economical process that has the undesirable effect of leaching out some of the natural flavor of the beans,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;27;Gourmet beans are dried more carefully usually by jets of warm air,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;28;The appropriate amount of flavoring to be used must be determined before flavor oils can be added to the roasted beans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;29;The rate of use typically varies between 23 Flavored Coffee Beanaveraging 27 industrywide,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;30;A 3 usage rate means that three pounds of flavor oil are added to 100 pounds of roasted beans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;31;The amount of flavoring required depends primarily on the type of flavor and its intensity as well as the type of bean used and its roast level,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;32;Cost constraints also may play a role in determining how much flavoring to apply to the beans because flavors are relatively expensive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;33;The combination of flavors to be used and the quantity to be applied to the beans is established by experimental trial and error in which test batches of beans are flavored with small quantities of oil until the desired characteristics are obtained,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;34;This formulation process is similar to the way one decides how much sugar to put in a cup of coffee or tea—add a small amount taste it and if necessary add a little more,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;35;Once the precise amount is set the dosage is held constant for that particular flavor oil and roasted bean combination,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;36;For different combinations of oils and beans the usage level must be readjusted for optimal results,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;37;Flavors are typically added to roasted beans before they are ground,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;38;The beans are placed in a large mixer which is specially designed to gently tumble the beans without causing them damage,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;39;Examples of this type of mixer include ribbon blenders drum rotators and candy pan coaters,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;40;The flavors are usually introduced via a pressurized spray mechanism which breaks the oils into tiny droplets which allows for better mixing,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;41;Oils must be added to the beans very gradually to guard against areas of highly concentrated flavor called hot spots,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;42;The beans are agitated for a set amount of time to ensure the flavor is evenly spread,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;43;This process may take 1530 minutes depending on the batch size and mixing characteristics of the oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;44;When the beans are properly coated they take on a glossy finish that indicates a uniform distribution of oils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;45;It is also important to note that instead of flavoring whole beans flavors in dry form can be blended with ground coffee,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;46;In such cases the flavors are encapsulated in starch or some other powdered matrix,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;47;There is enough moisture in the coffee to promote transfer of flavor and color from the encapsulated flavors to the coffee grounds in about 24 hours after mixing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;48;The finished product is packed in bags or cans as quickly as possible and sealed to prevent contact with the atmosphere,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;49;Prior to packaging the container is flushed with nitrogen (an inert gas) a process that removes oxygen from the container,Relevant
MadeHow;Flavored Coffee Bean;50;Oxygen can react with components of the flavor oils and the beans and cause deterioration,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Golf Ball;1;Threepiece golf balls are more difficult to make and can require more than 80 different manufacturing steps and 32 inspections taking up to 30 days to make one ball,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;2;Twopiece balls require about half of these steps and can be produced in as little as one day,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;3;The center of the twopiece ball is a molded core,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;4;It is a blend of several different ingredients all of which are chemically reactive to give a rubber type compound,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;5;After heat and pressure is applied a core of about 15 inches (375 cm) is formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;6;Injection molding or compression molding is used to form the cover and dimples on a twopiece ball using a twopiece mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;7;In injection molding the core is centered within a mold cavity by pins and molten thermoplastic is injected into the dimpled cavity surrounding the core,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;8;Heat and pressure cause the cover material to flow to join with the center forming the dimpled shape and size of the finished ball,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;9;As the plastic cools and hardens the pins are retracted and the finished balls are removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;10;With compression molding the cover is first injection molded into two hollow hemispheres,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;11;These are positioned around the core heated and then pressed together using a mold which fuses the cover to the core and also forms the dimples,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;12;Threepiece balls are all compression molded since the hot plastic flowing through would distort and probably cause breaks in the rubber threads,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;13;Flash or rough spots and the seam on the molded cover are removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;14;Two coats of paint are applied to the ball,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;15;Each ball sits on two posts which spins so that the paint is applied uniformly,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;16;Spray guns that are automatically controlled are used to apply the paint,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;17;Next the ball is stamped with the logo,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;18;The final step is the application of a clear coat for high sheen and scuff resistance,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;19;Drying and packaging 5 After the paint is applied the balls are loaded into containers and placed in large dryers,Relevant
MadeHow;Golf Ball;20;After drying the balls are ready for packaging in boxes and other containers,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;1;Graham crackers are made through a series of steps which convert the raw ingredients Graham Crackerinto finished products,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;2;Important steps include ingredient handling compounding forming or machining baking post conditioning and packaging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;3;Most of the major ingredients like flour vegetable shortening and sugar are delivered to cracker manufacturers in large quantities and stored in bulk tanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;4;Depending on the ingredient these tanks may be fashioned with special equipment to control their internal environments,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;5;For example a liquid such as vegetable shortening must be stored at a specific temperature until it is ready to be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;6;If the temperature varies too much the shortening could be difficult to pump or could adversely affect the dough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;7;Therefore this tank has controls which can maintain the appropriate temperature,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;8;Other tanks may have refrigeration capabilities,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;9;At the start of cracker production ingredients are transferred to mixing tanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;10;Liquid bulk ingredients are transferred using metered pumps which can move a specific quantity of material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;11;Bulk solid materials are pumped via a method called pneumatic transfer which involves fluidizing the powders with a stream of air and then pumping them with metered pumps,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;12;Minor ingredients that are supplied in boxes bags and drums are weighed and poured into the mixing tank by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;13;The graham cracker ingredients are mixed together in specific quantities as specified in the recipe,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;14;Cracker doughs are mixed with either vertical spindle mixers or highspeed horizontal drum mixers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;15;The order that ingredients are added to the mixture is important,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;16;Typically the process begins with sugar water and shortening,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;17;This forms a mixture with a creamlike consistency,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;18;Next the remaining ingredients are added and a short dough is obtained,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;19;This dough is allowed to set for two to three hours for the leavening agents to work,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;20;Graham crackers are usually sold in two forms as squares or as animal crackers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;21;The dough used for both is ostensibly the same,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;22;In the machining process the dough is delivered from a hopper onto a conveyor belt and rolled thin by a series of metal gauging rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;23;The thickness of the sheet is reduced by each of these rollers,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;24;Some manufacturers stack multiple sheets on top of each other in a process known as laminating,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;25;They are rolled out further allowed to relax and then sent along a conveyor belt to the cutting machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;26;The edges of the dough sheets are cut smooth by rotary cutting machines and excess dough is sent back to the hopper for reuse,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;27;When animal crackers are made the sheet of dough is cut into the various animal shapes by cutting machines called stampers,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;28;These stampers or rotary dies have the animal shapes fashioned on them with intricate details,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;29;After this stage sugar cinnamon or honey are applied to the top of the dough if the recipe requires it,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;30;The crackers are baked in a tunnel oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;31;The dough is first transferred to a metal conveyor belt and then moved through the oven which can be 100300 feet (3090 m) long,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;32;Baking takes place in three stages called development drying and coloring,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;33;In the development stage the dough sets taking on the size and shape of the final product,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;34;The greatest amount of water is lost in the drying stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;35;In the coloring stage the dough is changed from pale white to a light golden brown,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;36;The amount of time a product spends baking is controlled by the speed of the moving conveyor belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;37;Animal crackers bake for as little as four minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;38;Graham crackers bake slightly longer,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;39;After the crackers come out of the oven they travel on a series of conveyors to cool,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;40;At some point in this process they are flipped over and then flipped back to ensure that cooling is throughout,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;41;The total cooling time can be twice as long as the baking time,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;42;Depending on the recipe other coatings can be put on the crackers after they have cooled,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;43;These include such things as icings chocolate coatings or sugar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;44;These can be applied using either stenciling extruders or depositors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;45;Excess toppings are removed using forced air and vibrating shaker devices,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;46;The final step in the manufacturing process is packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;47;Because of the fragile nature of some crackers the packaging must be rigid and airtight,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;48;For square graham crackers the crackers are cut and stacked individually and wrapped in flexible films,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;49;Animal crackers which are less fragile are typically packaged in a coated bag,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;50;Both types of crackers are then put inside boxes which are appropriately decorated to make the product appealing,Relevant
MadeHow;Graham Cracker;51;These boxes are put into larger case boxes which can be stacked on pallets and shipped to stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;1;Gummy manufacturing uses a starch molding process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;2;First the candy is made then it is filled into starched lined trays,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;3;The filled trays are then cooled overmight and the resulting formed candy is emptied from the trays,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;4;In the mass production of gummy candy significant improvements have been made to increase the speed and efficiency of this process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;5;The manufacture of gummy candy begins with compounding,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;6;Factory workers known as compounders follow instructions outlined in the recipes and physically pour the appropriate amount of gummy raw materials into the main mixing tanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;7;These tanks which are equipped with mixing heating and cooling capabilities are quite large,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;8;Depending on the size of the batch gummy candy compounding can take from one to three hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;9;When the batch is complete it is sent to the Quality Control (QC) laboratory to make sure that it meets the required specifications,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;10;After the gummy candy is compounded and passes QC testing it is either pumped or transferred to a starch molding machine known as a Mogul,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;11;This machine can automatically perform the multiple tasks involved in making gummy candy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;12;It is called a starch molding machine because starch is a main component,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;13;In this machine starch has three primary purposes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;14;First it prevents the candy from sticking to the candy molds which allows for easy removal and handling,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;15;Second it holds the gummy candy in place during the drying cooling and setting processes,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;16;Finally it absorbs moisture from the candies giving them the proper texture,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;17;Making gummy candy in a Mogul is a continuous process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;18;At the start of the machine trays that contain previously filled cooled and formed gummy candy are stacked,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;19;The trays are then removed from the stack onebyone and iwove along a conveyor belt into the next section of the machine known as the starch buck,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;20;As they enter the starch buck the trays are inverted and the gummy candy falls out into a vibrating metal screen known as a sieve,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;21;The vibrating action of the sieve in concert with oscillating brushes removes all of the excess starch that adheres to the gummy candy,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;22;These pieces then move along a conveyor belt to trays where they are manually transferred to other machines by which they can be decorated further and placed into appropriate packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;23;A more recent advance called the pneumatic starch buck further automates this step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;24;In this device a tightly fitting cover is placed over the filled trays,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;25;When it is inverted the candies adhere to the cover and remain in their ordered position,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;26;The excess starch is then removed by fastrotating compressedair jets,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;27;The candy can then be conveyed for further processing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;28;Gummy candy is manufactured in a machine called a Mogul,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;29;Cooled trays of gummy candy are inverted in the starch buck,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;30;This candy is ready for packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;31;The trays are then filled with starch to keep the candy from sticking and sent to the printer table which imprints a pattern into the starch,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;32;The depositor fills the trays with the hot candy mixture and the trays are sent back to the stacker to cool for 24 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;33;Then the machine can start the process again,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;34;The starch that is removed from the gummy candy is reused in the process but first it must be cleaned dried and otherwise reconditioned,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;35;Candy particles are first removed by passing the starch through a metal screen known as a sieve,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;36;It is then conveyed to a recirculating starch conditioning system,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;37;As it enters this machine it is dried by being passed through hot moving air,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;38;After drying the starch is cooled by cool air jets and conveyed back out to the Mogul to be reused in the starch molding process,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;39;The starch returns from the drier via a conveyor belt to the Mogul where it is filled into the empty trays and leveled,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;40;These were the same trays that were inverted and emptied in step two,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;41;These starchfilled trays then move to a printer table,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;42;Here a board that has the inverse of the mold printed on it presses the starch down so the mold has an indent in it,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;43;From here the trays are moved to the depositors,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;44;The gummy candy compounded in step 1 is transferred to the depositors,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;45;This is the part of the mogul that has a filling nozzle and can deliver the exact amount of candy needed into the trays as they pass under it,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;46;The depositor section of the mogul can contain 30 or more depositors depending on how many imprints there are on the trays,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;47;In more modern depositors the color flavor and acids can be added to the gummy base right in the depositor,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;48;This allows different colors and flavors to be made simultaneously speeding up the process,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;49;The filled trays are moved along to a stacking machine and then sent to a cooling room where they stay until they are appropriately cooled and formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;50;This part of the process can take over 24 hours,Relevant
MadeHow;Gummy Candy;51;After this happens the trays are moved back to the Mogul and the process starts all over again,Relevant
MadeHow;Hair Dye;1;Before a batch of hair dye is made the ingredients must be certified,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Instant Coffee;4;It then passes through two or more cold cells (about 212°F or 100°C) for extraction of the more flavorful elements,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;5;The extract is passed through a heat exchanger to cool it to about 40°F (5°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;6;By the end of this cycle the coffee extract contains 2030 solids,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;7;After a filtering step the brewed coffee is treated in one of several ways to increase its concentration,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;8;The goal is to create an extract that is about 40 solids,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;9;In some cases the liquid is processed in a centrifuge to separate out the lighter water from the heavier coffee extract,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;10;Another technique is to remove water by evaporation before cooling the hot brewed extract,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;11;A third alternative is to cool the extract enough to freeze water and then mechanically separate the ice crystals from the coffee concentrate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;12;Part of the enjoyment of making and drinking coffee is smelling the aroma,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;13;During the several steps of the manufacturing process volatile aromatic elements are lost they must be returned in a later step to produce an attractive instant coffee product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;14;Aromatics can be recovered during several stages of the manufacturing process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;15;For instance gases released during the roasting andor grinding processes can be collected,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;16;Ground roasted coffee can be heated to release additional aromatic gases,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;17;Passing steam or appropriate solvents through a bed of ground roasted coffee can strip and capture aromatic components,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;18;Aromatic oils can be expressed from spent coffee grounds by exerting pressure of at least 2000 lb per sq in (14000 kPa),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;19;Gases can also be distilled from coffee extract after the brewing process is complete,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;20;To preserve as much of the aroma and flavor as possible oxygen is removed from the coffee extract,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;21;This is accomplished by foaming other gases such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen through the liquid before it enters the dehydration phase of the manufacturing process,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;22;Two basic methods are available for converting the liquid coffee extract to a dry form,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;23;Spray drying is done at a higher temperature which affects the taste of the final product but it is less costly than freeze drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;24;Cooled clarified liquid concentrate is sprayed through a nozzle at the top of a drying tower,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;25;The tower is at least 75 ft (23 m) tall,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;26;Air that has been heated to about 480°F (250°C) is blown downward through the mist to evaporate the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;27;The air is diverted out of the tower near the bottom and it is filtered to remove fine particles which can be recirculated back through the tower or reintroduced during the agglomeration step,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;28;The dry coffee powder collects in the bottom of the tower before being discharged for further processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;29;The resulting powder contains 24 moisture and consists of freeflowing nondusty particles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;30;Spray drying may be followed by a step to form the powder into coarser particles that will dissolve more completely in the consumers cup,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;31;The agglomeration process Instant Coffeebasically involves rewetting the surfaces of the coffee powder particles and bringing the particles into contact so that they will adhere to each other and form larger more granular particles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;32;This is accomplished by exposing the powder to steam or a fine mist while tumbling it in the air,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;33;Freeze drying may be used instead of spray drying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;34;The process involves four steps beginning with primary freezing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;35;Coffee extract is chilled to a slushy consistency at about 20°F (6°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;36;The prechilled slush is placed on a steel belt trays or drums and further cooled in a series of steps until it reaches a temperature of 40(50)°F (40[45]°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;37;Quick cooling processes (taking 30120 seconds) result in smaller lighter colored products while slower processes (taking 10180 minutes) generate larger darker granules,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;38;The slabs of ice are broken into pieces and ground into particles of the proper size for the drying step,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;39;The particles are sieved to ensure proper sizing and those that are too small are melted and returned to the primary freezing stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;40;The frozen particles are sent into a drying chamber where under proper conditions of heat and vacuum the ice vaporizes and is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;41;Volatile aromas that have been recovered from earlier steps in the manufacturing process are sprayed on the dry coffee particles,Relevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;42;This may be done during the packaging operation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;43;Instant coffee particles are hygroscopic—that is they absorb moisture from the air,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;44;Consequently they must be packaged under low humidity conditions in a moistureproof container to keep the product dry until purchased and opened by the consumer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Instant Coffee;45;Also to prevent loss of aroma and flavor the product is packaged in a lowoxygen atmosphere (usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen),Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;1;The process of creating ironon decals involves three key steps preparation of the stencil to be used to print the image the screen printing process itself and transfer of the image to the fabric substrate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;2;The first step is to create a stencil of the image,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;3;As described above stencils are IronOn DecalIronOn Decalmade from paper or plastic sheets which are coated with a thin layer of lacquer or gelatin,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;4;An outline of the image to be printed is cut into this thin layer and the lacquer or gelatin is peeled away,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;5;A solvent is then used to adhere the stencil to the underside of the fabric screen,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;6;Once the stencil has dried on the screen the paper or plastic backing sheet is removed leaving only the film layer,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;7;The portions of the stencil that were cut away expose a section of the screen through which ink can be forced,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;8;Such stencils may be produced from photographic images by a similar process but instead of cutting away the portions of the image a lightsensitive material is used to mark an image on the screen,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;9;Alternatively the stencil may be painted directly on the screen using tusche,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;10;Image transfer is accomplished by forcing various inks which are placed on top of the screen fabric through the stencil and onto the printing substrate,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;11;A rubber squeegee is used to force ink through openings in the stencil,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;12;Ink application may be done by hand or by automated printing processes,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;13;The different colors are laid down sequentially one at a time,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;14;The plastisol type must be heated to cure after each application,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;15;This curing is done at temperatures of 225250°F (107121°C),Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;16;The ink must be heated to this temperature for about one minute and then cooled before the next color can be added,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;17;(The sublimation type requires no heat curing),Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;18;It should also be noted that the colors are laid down in reverse order from last to first,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;19;Therefore the finished decal resembles a multilayer sandwich,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;20;The bottom layer is the release paper followed by what are called the detail colors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;21;Then the background colors are laid down one at a time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;22;Upon completion of the printing process the image is ready to be transferred to a Tshirt or other garment,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;23;Before transferring the image the fabric must be laid out on a smooth hard surface,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;24;For a Tshirt a piece of heavy cardboard is inserted between its front and back to provide firm support and prevent the transfer from sticking to the back of the garment,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;25;Heat and pressure are then applied using an ordinary household iron or a special piece of equipment called a dry mounting press,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;26;The latter consists of two flat electrically heated metal plates that provide even pressure and heat to the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;27;Using the dry press allows for better image transfer with less chance of scorching,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;28;For ironon decals made with plastisol inks the dry press is set to about 300°F (149°C),Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;29;This temperature is adequate to melt the lacquer layer holding the inks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;30;Continued heat and pressure for one to three minutes cause the molten inklacquer film to migrate to the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;31;When the heat source is removed the inklacquer combination cools and binds to the fabric,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;32;After cooling is complete the paper backing is peeled away,Relevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;33;A similar process is used for sublimation inks except no carrier layer is needed because the pigments vaporize and transfer directly to the fabric as result of heat and pressure,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;34;A temperature of 350375°F (177191°C) is usually sufficient to affect this change,Irrelevant
MadeHow;IronOn Decal;35;Sublimation inks transfer more cleanly than the plastisol type since there is no lacquer coating or film to be transferred,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;1;Growing and processing natural rubber is one of the most complex agricultural industries and requires several years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;2;It combines botany chemistry and sophisticated machinery with dexterous skills of the people who harvest the trees,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;3;Contrast this with synthetic rubber production which involves chemical reactions and sophisticated chemical processing machinery that is automatically controlled by computers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;4;The production of natural latex is described below,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;5;Seeds from highgrade trees are planted and allowed to grow for about 12 to 18 months in the nursery before a new bud is grafted to the seedling,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;6;After bud grafting the yearold seedling tree is cut back and is ready for transplanting,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;7;The bud sprouts shortly after transplanting resulting in a new tree with better properties,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;8;Approximately 150 trees are planted per acre (375 per ha) which are cultivated and cared for until they are ready for tapping in about six to seven years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;9;To harvest latex a worker shaves off a slanted strip of bark halfway around the tree and about one third in (084 cm) deep,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;10;Precise skill is required for if the tree is cut too deeply the tree will be irreparably damaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;11;If the cut is too shallow the maximum amount of latex will not flow,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;12;The latex then bleeds out of the severed vessels flows down along the cut until it reaches a spout and finally drops into a collection cup that will later be drained,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;13;Tapping is repeated every other day by making thin shavings just below the previous cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;14;When the last scar created by the cuts is about 1 ft (03 m) above the ground the other side of the tree is tapped in similar fashion while the first side renews itself,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;15;Each tapping takes about three hours and produces less than a cup of latex,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;16;A tapper first collects the cut lump which is coagulated latex in the cup and tree lace which is latex coagulated along the old cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;17;Next the tapper makes a new cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;18;The latex first flows rapidly then declines to a steady rate for a few hours after which it slows again,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;19;By the next day the flow has nearly stopped as the severed vessel becomes plugged by coagulated latex,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;20;To prevent most of the liquid latex from coagulating before it can be conveniently pooled and transported the tapper adds a preservative such as ammonia or formaldehyde to the collection cup,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;21;Both the liquid and coagulated latex is sent to factories for processing,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;22;To increase tree yields and reduce tapping times chemical stimulants are used,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;23;Puncture tapping in which the bark is quickly pierced with sharp needles is another method that can improve productivity since it enables the same worker to tap more trees per day,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;24;About 10 of the latex is processed into a liquid concentrate by removing some of the water and increasing the rubber content to 60,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;25;This is achieved either by spinning the water out of the latex through centrifugal force by evaporation or by a method known as creaming,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;26;In this method a chemical agent is added to the latex that causes the rubber particles to swell and rise to the liquids surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;27;The concentrate is shipped in liquid form to factories where it is used for coatings adhesives and other applications,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;28;Other rubber and field latex is coagulated with acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;29;A giant extrusion dryer that can produce up to 4000 lbs (1816 kg) per hour removes the water creating a crumblike material,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;30;The dried rubber is then compacted into bales and crated for shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;31;Ribbed smoked sheets are made by first diluting the latex and adding acid,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;32;The acid makes rubber particles bunch together above the watery serum in which they are suspended,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;33;After several hours roughly one pound (045 kg) of soft gelatinous rubber coagulates for every three pounds (135 kg) of latex,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Latex;34;The rubber is allowed to stand for one to 18 hours then the slabs are pressed into thin sheets through a system of rollers that wrings out excess liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;35;The final set of rollers leaves a ribbed pattern on the sheets that increases the surface area and hastens drying,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;36;The sheets are dried for up to a week in smoke houses before being packed and shipped,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;37;To make rubber products the mix is shaped by placing it in a heated mold which helps shape and vulcanize the material,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;38;For more complex products such as tires a number of components are made some with fiber or steelcord reinforcement which are then joined together,Relevant
MadeHow;Latex;39;Surgical gloves are made by dipping a ceramic form into latex withdrawing the form and then drying the latex shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;1;In the United States most trees destined to be cut into lumber are grown in managed forests either owned by the lumber company or leased from the government,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;2;After the trees have reached an appropriate size they are cut down and transported to a lumber mill where they are cut into various sizes of lumber,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;3;Here is a typical sequence of operations for processing trees into lumber,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;4;Selected trees in an area are visually inspected and marked as being ready to be cut down or felled,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;5;If a road does not already exist in the area one is cut and graded using bulldozers,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;6;If operations are expected to extend into the rainy season the road may be graveled and culverts may be installed across streams to prevent washouts,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;7;Most tree felling is done with gasolinepowered chain saws,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;8;Two cuts are made near the base one on each side to control the direction the tree will fall,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;9;Once the tree is down the limbs are trimmed off with chain saws and the tree is cut into convenient lengths for transportation,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;10;If the terrain is relatively level dieselpowered tractors called skidders are used to drag the fallen tree sections to a cleared area for loading,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;11;If the terrain is steep a selfpropelled yarder is used,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;12;The yarder has a telescoping hydraulic tower that can be raised to a height of 110 ft (335 m),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;13;Guy wires support the tower and cables are run from the top of the tower down the steep slopes to retrieve the felled trees,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;14;The tree sections or logs are then loaded on trucks using wheeled log loaders,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;15;The trucks make their way down the graded road and onto public highways on their way to the lumber mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;16;Once at the mill giant mobile unloaders grab the entire truck load in one bite and stack it in long piles known as log decks,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;17;The decks are periodically sprayed with water to prevent the wood from drying out and shrinking,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;18;Logs are picked up from the log deck with rubbertired loaders and are placed on a chain conveyor that brings them into the mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;19;In some cases the outer bark of the log is removed either with sharptoothed grinding wheels or with a jet of highpressure water while the log is slowly rotated about its long axis,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;20;The removed bark is pulverized and may be used as a fuel for the mills furnaces or may be sold as a decorative garden mulch,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;21;The logs are carried into the mill on the chain conveyor where they stop momentarily as a huge circular saw cuts them into predetermined lengths,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;22;This process is called bucking and the saw is called a bucking saw,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;23;If the log has a diameter larger than 23 ft (0609 m) it is tipped off the conveyor and clamped onto a moveable carriage that slides lengthwise on a set of rails,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;24;The carriage can position the log transversely relative to the rails and can also rotate the log 90 or 180 degrees about its length,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;25;Optical sensors scan the log and determine its diameter at each end its length and any visible defects,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;26;Based on this information a computer then calculates a suggested cutting pattern to maximize the number of pieces of lumber obtainable from the log,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;27;The headrig sawyer sits in an enclosed booth next to a large vertical bandsaw called the headrig saw,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;28;He reviews the suggested cutting pattern displayed on a television monitor but relies more on his experience to make the series of cuts,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;29;The log is fed lengthwise through the vertical bandsaw,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;30;The first cut is made along the side closest to the operator and removes a piece of wood called a slab,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;31;The outer surface of the slab has the curvature of the original tree trunk and this piece is usually discarded and ground to chips for use in paper pulp,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;32;The carriage is returned to its original position and the log is shifted sideways Depending on the size of log it may be cut in different ways to optimize the size and number of resulting boards,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;33;After boards are cut they are dried and planed,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;34;Depending on the size of log it may be cut in different ways to optimize the size and number of resulting boards,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Lumber;35;After boards are cut they are dried and planed or rotated to make subsequent cuts,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;36;The headrig sawyer must constantly review the log for internal defects and modify the cutting pattern accordingly as each successive cut opens the log further,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;37;In general thinner pieces destined to be made into boards are cut from the outer portion of the log where there are fewer knots,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;38;Thicker pieces for dimension lumber are cut next while the center of the log yields stock for heavy timber pieces,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;39;Smaller diameter logs are fed through a series of bandsaws that cut them into nominal 1 in (25 cm) 2 in (5 cm) or 4 in (10 cm) thick pieces in one pass,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;40;The large cut pieces from the headrig saw called cants are laid flat and moved by chain conveyor to multipleblade bandsaws where they are cut into the required widths and the outside edges are trimmed square,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;41;The pieces that were cut from smaller logs may also pass through multipleblade bandsaws to cut them to width,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;42;If the pieces are small enough that they do not need further cutting they may pass through a chipper which grinds the uneven edges square,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;43;The cut and trimmed pieces of lumber are then moved to an area to be dried or seasoned,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;44;This is necessary to prevent decay and to permit the wood to shrink as it dries out Timbers because of their large dimensions are difficult to thoroughly dry and are generally sold wet or green,Relevant
MadeHow;Lumber;45;Other lumber may be air dried or kiln dried depending on the required moisture content of the finished piece,Relevant

MadeHow;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);31;Attached to it is the user interface the Fourier transformer the signal converter and a preamplifier,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);32;A display device and a laser printer are also included,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);33;Each of the components of the MRI are assembled together and placed into an appropriate frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);34;Assembly can take place at the plant or onsite where the system will be used,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);35;In either case the nature of the magnet typically requires special handling precautions such as transporting it in an airsuspended vehicle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;1;In the making of maple syrup one could say that the farmer comes last and not be wrong,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;2;The sap of the maple will never become maple syrup until the farmer intercedes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;3;The following five components make up that transformation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;4;In the winter the maple does not grow and it stores its sap in its roots,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;5;By late spring when the trees begin to produce leaves and flowers a chemical change will have occurred in the sap giving it an unpleasant taste which farmers describe as buddy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;6;It is only in early spring usually February through April when warm days cause the sap to flow up from the roots to the branches to feed new growth and cold nights cause the sap to return to the roots that the trees can be tapped A W Mayo and Son promoted their family maple syrup and confection business on a sleigh (From the collections of Henry Ford Museum Greenfield Village) Americans have always had a sweet tooth Native Americans satisfied their taste for sugar through the production of maple syrup and European settlers of New England learned the practice After the Revolutionary War many farm families in the northern United States and territories produced maple syrup and maple sugar for home consumption Surveyors of new territories noted the presence of sugar trees and settlers named streams near maple groves Sugar Creek,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;7;Cane sugar production in America did not develop until the late eighteenth century,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;8;The growing season in the southern part of the United States did not allow sugar cane to mature and no methods of processing immature cane existed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;9;In 1795 in what was then French territory Etienne de Bore perfected a means of crystallizing sugar from immature sugar cane in New Orleans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;10;Other planters copied de Bore and the American cane sugar industry began,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;11;By 1802 75 sugar plantations produced as much as eight million Ib (four million kg) of brown sugar,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;12;When the United States acquired the Louisiana Purchase it gained these sources of sugar production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;13;Midwestern farmers and later Western producers who used irrigation grew sugar beets to sell to sugar processors,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;14;Sugars from cane and beets are generally used for baking but maple syrup and maple sugar remain popular in spite of other sweeteners,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;15;Families with an affinity for this tasty confection continue to tap trees in the spring and thousands of Americans purchase maple syrup to pour over their morning stack of pancakes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;16;To tap a maple tree farmers drill a 05 in (13 cm) hole about 253 in (68 cm) into the trunk,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;17;The hole is drilled at a slightly upward angle to prevent sap from collecting in the hole freezing and cracking the trunk,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;18;Care is taken only to drill into the lightcolored sapwood which will heal and not into the darker heartwood which will not,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;19;Trees from 1215 in (30538 cm) in diameter supports one tap and the number of taps increases as the trees grow larger with a maximum of four taps per tree,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;20;Each tap yields an average of 10 gal (38 1) of sap per season which makes about a quart of syrup,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;21;New holes must be drilled at least 4 in (10 cm) above and 6 in (15 cm) to either side of previous holes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;22;This prevents large areas of scar tissue from forming in the wood and leaving the tree open to disease,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;23;Properly cared for the holes will heal completely in one or two years and will cause no damage to the tree,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;24;To collect maple sap holes are drilled into the trees and hollow spikes are inserted,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;25;Traditionally pails collected the syrup that dripped out but modern systems send the sap directly to the sugar house,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;26;Once the tree is tapped farmers gently drive a hollow spike called a spile into the hole,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;27;The spile is a round hollow piece of wood about the diameter of a broom handle with a metal tip to help drive the end into the wood,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;28;Traditional methods use a canvas bag or a bucket hung from the spile to catch the dripping sap,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;29;The bucket or bag is covered to keep out debris,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;30;Once a day the farmer empties the buckets into a large gathering tank pulled through the fields by a horse or tractor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;31;The tank is pulled to the building where the sap is processed called the sugar house and emptied into a holding tank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;32;While the sight of pails hung from maples and the sound of dripping sap is much more romantic than modern systems this traditional method of collection has a few inherent flaws especially for largescale producers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;33;The first is that collecting syrup bucket by bucket is both time and labor intensive and is therefore costly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;34;The second is that sap should be processed immediately after being collected in order to produce the best quality syrup,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;35;Under the traditional system if collection exceeds production the sap must be stored,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;36;And if collection falls behind production must slow,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;37;Modern systems eliminate the collection process altogether and send sap straight from the trees to the sugar house,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;38;To accomplish this a plastic tube is attached to each spile the tubes run together to a larger pipe and the pipes in turn run from the various parts of the orchard directly to the sugar house,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;39;A pump maintains a constant slight vacuum and keeps the sap constantly moving through the pipeline,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;40;Collected sap enters the holding tank and then travels to the flue pan,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;41;Here it is heated concentrating the sap and causing a chemical change,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;42;Maple sap becomes maple syrup at the moment when its concentration of sugar reaches 66,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;43;The syrup is filtered and poured into containers,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;44;Possibly the most important piece of the maple syrupmaking process takes place in the sugar house,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;45;The initial sugar content of the sap its clarity and to some extent its taste are all determined by weather soil and ultimately the tree all of which are outside the control of the grower,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;46;It is only through the process of heating and condensing the sap that it takes on the distinctive sweet flavor of maple syrup,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;47;Most commercial syrup producers use a continuous feed system to make syrup,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;48;Sap continuously but very slowly enters from a holding tank on one end and finished syrup is continuously drained and bottled at the other end,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;49;The sap is heated over a wood or oilfueled fire in a series of long shallow stainless steel pans,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;50;This causes the water in the sap to steam off condensing the sap and causes a chemical change in the sap which brings out a flavor not present before it is heated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;51;The sap first enters the flue pan which has a corrugated bottom lined with a series of pipes called flues,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;52;The flues serve two purposes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;53;First the fire heats the air inside the flues which provides a more even gentle heat than the fire gives directly and which allows the sap to be heated longer and at a higher temperature evaporating more water without the danger of scorching the sap,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;54;Second the wavy pan bottom increases the surface area of the pan and allows more syrup to be in contact with the heat at the same time,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;55;From the flue pan the sap flows into the flatbottomed syrup pan where it is finished,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;56;The two pans are divided by partitions that allow a slow constant flow of sap,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;57;Maple sap becomes maple syrup at the moment when its concentration of sugar reaches 66,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;58;Producers test this concentration using two methods,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;59;The first uses the formula that syrup is finished when it reaches the temperature at which water boils plus 71°F (43°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;60;Because water boils at different temperatures depending on altitude producers boil a sample of water and measure its temperature,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;61;When the syrup reaches the samples temperature plus 71°F (43°C) it is done,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;62;The second perhaps more scientific method involves an instrument called a hydrometer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;63;A hydrometer is a sealed glass tube with a small amount of weight in one end,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;64;Running horizontally around the outside of the tube are a series of lines which indicate concentration in percentage the lines are specially calibrated for maple syrup,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;65;Once the sap has been heated a sample is placed in a cylinder and the hydrometer is placed in the sap,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;66;The hydrometer sinks to the line that indicates the current sugar concentration in the sap,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;67;When the hydrometer sinks to the line that indicates 66 the sap has become syrup,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;68;As the sugar approaches 66 it is checked constantly,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;69;Finishing the syrup at the proper sugar concentration is critical too high and the syrup will crystallize too low and it will spoil,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;70;Once the syrup is properly finished it is poured through a cloth filter to remove any sugar sand called nitre,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;71;It is then poured into glass or metal containers while still hot,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;72;The container is filled to the very top and then tightly sealed,Relevant
MadeHow;Maple Syrup;73;Because maple syrup contains no preservatives this final step ensures that the container is sterile and airtight and prevents any spoiling,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marker;1;The ink mixture is concocted,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;2;Preferable ratios are 110 water by weight (the water content must be sufficient for complete dissolution or dispersion of the dye) with the remainder of the weight being made up of a solvent such as alkyl or alkylene carbonate,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marker;3;Conventional additives such as nonylphenylpolyglycol ether alkylpolyglycol ether fatty acid polyglycol ester or fatty alcohol ethoxalates and preservatives such as orthophenolphenyl and its sodium salt orthohydroxydiphenyl or 6acetoxy24dimethhylmdioxane may also be added to the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;4;To make the body of the marker plastic resin is injectionmolded into a marker body,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;5;Injection molding involves heating a substance in this case plastic resin into a molten state and forcing (injecting) it into a mold of the desired shape then allowing it to cool and harden,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;6;Marker caps and plugs are formed in the same manner as the barrel,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;7;The nib or tip of the marker is made from powder which is mixed with water molded and baked into its pointed or flat form,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;8;Using one machine for all the following functions an assembler then places a polyester cylinder inside the marker barrel to form a reservoir for the ink fills the reservoir with ink and inserts the nib at the bottom and the cap at the top,Relevant
MadeHow;Marker;9;The markers are then placed into color assortment and packaged for retail marketing,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;1;A solution is formed by dissolving sugar and corn syrup in water and boiling it,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;2;Egg whites andor gelatin is mixed with the sugar solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;3;Then the ingredients are heated in a cook kettle to about 240°F (115°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;4;The resulting mixture is passed through a strainer to remove extraneous matter,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;5;In the pump the mixture is then beaten into a foam to two or three times its original volume,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;6;At this stage flavoring can be added,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;7;Paradise pudding from the recipe booklet The JellO Girl Entertains circa 1930,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;8;(From the collections of Henry Ford Museum Greenfield Village),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;9;In the early twentieth century marshmallows were considered a childs confection dispensed as penny candy at general stores along with licorice whips and peppermint drops,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;10;But through a fortuitous connection with other popular foods and some clever marketing marshmallows would soon become a staple ingredient at potluck dinners family gettogethers and even elegant parties,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;11;A perusal through twentiethcentury cookbooks and recipe booklets reveals that marshmallows usually served as an ingredient in cakes candies and desserts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;12;They also became wellknown as a topping for steaming cups of hot cocoa and as a roasted treat at cookouts and picnics,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;13;Increasingly they served as a sweet addition to salads and side dishes including their classic contribution to the Thanksgiving dinner table—atop a dish of baked sweet potatoes or yarns,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;14;The heated mixture is transferred to a heat exchanger,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;15;Air is pumped into the mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;16;The mixture cools in a tempering kettle passes through another filter and Marshmallow continues on to the hill,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;17;Marshmallows are extruded through a machine or deposited onto bands,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;18;The extrusion process involves the foam being squeezed through a die to produce marshmallows familiar pillow shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;19;Usually they get a coating of corn starch to counter stickiness and help maintain their form after they have been extruded,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;20;Sometimes the pillows are formed into a rope of pillows,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;21;If so they are cut and dried on a rubber conveyor belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;22;After the pillows are formed they are sent through a cooling drum where excess starch is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;23;They also are cooled enough to be packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;24;After the pillows have cooled they are weighed and packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;25;Before being put in cases some manufacturers pass their product through a metal detector,Relevant
MadeHow;Marshmallow;26;The case is code dated and shipped to retail stores,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;1;There are two main types of mascara currently manufactured,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;2;One type is called anhydrous meaning it contains no water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;3;The second type is made with a lotion base and it is manufactured by the emulsion method,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;4;In this method ingredients are mixed in tanks or kettles which make a small batch of 1030 gal (38114 1),Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;5;The ingredients are first carefully measured and weighed,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;6;Then a worker empties them into the mixing tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;7;Heat is applied to melt the waxes and the mixture is agitated usually by means of a propeller blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;8;The agitation continues until the mixture reaches a semisolid state,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;9;Mascara can be made in two different ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;10;In the anhydrous method all the ingredients are mixed heated and agitated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;11;With the emulsion method water and thickeners are combined while the waxes and emulsifiers are mixed and heated separately,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;12;Pigments are added before both mixtures are combined in a highspeed agitator called a homogenizer,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;13;The result of either method is a semisolid substance that is ready to be packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;14;In this method water and thickeners are combined to make a lotion or cream base,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;15;Waxes and emulsifiers are heated and melted separately and pigments are added,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;16;Then the waxes and lotion base are combined in a very high speed mixer or homogenizer,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;17;Unlike the tank or kettle above the homogenizer is enclosed and mixes the ingredients at very high speed without incorporating any air or causing evaporation,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;18;The oils and waxes are broken down into very small beads by the rapid action of the homogenizer and held in suspension in the water,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;19;The homogenizer may hold as little as 5 gal (19 1) or as much as 100 gal (380 1),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mascara;20;The highspeed mixing action continues until the mixture reaches room temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;21;After the mascara solution has cooled or reached the proper state workers transfer it to a tote bin,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;22;Next they roll the tote bin to the filling area and empty the solution into a hopper on a filling machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;23;The filling machine pumps a measured amount (typically about 0175 oz [5 g]) of the solution into glass or plastic mascara bottles,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;24;The bottles are usually capped by hand,Relevant
MadeHow;Mascara;25;Samples are removed for inspection and the rest are readied for distribution,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;1;Matches are manufactured in several stages,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;2;In the case of woodenstick matches the matchsticks are first cut prepared and moved to a storage area,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;3;When the matchsticks are needed they are inserted into holes in a long perforated belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;4;The belt carries them through the rest of the process where they are dipped into several chemical tanks dried and packaged in boxes,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;5;Cardboardstick matches used in match books are processed in a similar manner,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;6;Here is a typical sequence of operations for manufacturing woodenstick matches ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;7;Logs of white pine or aspen are clamped in a debarking machine and slowly rotated while spinning blades cut away the outer bark of the tree,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;8;The stripped logs are then cut into short lengths about 16 ft (05 m) long,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;9;Each length is placed in a peeler and rotated while a sharp flat blade peels a long thin sheet of wood from the outer surface of the log,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;10;This sheet is about 01 in (25 mm) thick and is called a veneer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;11;The peeling blade moves inward toward the core of the rotating log until only a small round post is left,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;12;This post is discarded and may be used for fuel or reduced to wood chips for use in making paper or chipboard,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;13;Stripped logs are placed in a peeler which cuts a sheet about 01 in (25 mm) thick called veneer from the log,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;14;The veneer proceeds to the chopper which cuts it into small sticks,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;15;The sticks are soaked in a dilute solution of ammonium phosphate and dried removing splinters and crystallized solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;16;The matches are dumped into a feed hopper which lines them up,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;17;A perforated conveyor belt holds them upside down while they are dipped in a series of three tanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;18;The matches are dried for 5060 minutes before they are packaged,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;19;The sheets of veneer are stacked and fed into a chopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;20;The chopper has many sharp blades that cut down through the stack to produce as many as 1000 matchsticks in a single stroke,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;21;The cut matchsticks are dumped into a large vat filled with a dilute solution of ammonium phosphate,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;22;After they have soaked for several minutes the matchsticks are removed from the vat and placed in a large rotating drum like a clothes dryer,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;23;The tumbling action inside the drum dries the sticks and acts to polish and clean them of any splinters or crystallized chemical,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;24;The dried sticks are then dumped into a hopper and blown through a metal duct to the storage area,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;25;In some operations the sticks are blown directly into the matchmaking facility rather than going to storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;26;The sticks are blown from the storage area to a conveyor belt that transfers them to be inserted into holes on a long continuous perforated steel belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;27;The sticks are dumped into several vshaped feed hoppers that line them up with the holes in the perforated belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;28;Plungers push the matchsticks into the holes across the width of the slowly moving belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;29;A typical belt may have 50100 holes spaced across its width,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;30;Any sticks that do not seat firmly into the holes fall to a catch area beneath the belt and are transferred back to the feed hoppers,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;31;The perforated belt holds the matchsticks upside down and immerses the lower portion of the sticks in a bath of hot paraffin wax,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;32;After they emerge from the wax the sticks are allowed to dry,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;33;Further down the line the matchsticks are positioned over a tray filled with a liquid solution of the match head chemicals,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;34;The tray is then momentarily raised to immerse the ends of the sticks in the solution,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;35;Several thousand sticks are coated at the same time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;36;This cycle repeats itself when the next batch of sticks is in position,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;37;If the matches are the strikeanywhere kind the sticks move on to another tray filled with a solution of the tip chemicals and the match ends are immersed in that tray only this time not quite as deeply,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;38;This gives strikeanywhere matches their characteristic twotoned appearance,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;39;After the match heads are coated the matches must be dried very slowly or they will not light properly,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;40;The belt loops up and down several times as the matches dry for 5060 minutes,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;41;The cardboard inner and outer portions of the match boxes are cut printed folded and glued together in a separate area,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;42;If the box is to contain safety matches the chemicals for the striking strip are mixed with an adhesive and are automatically applied to the outer portion of the box,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;43;When the matches are dry the belt moves them to the packaging area where a multitoothed wheel pushes the finished matches out of the holes in the belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;44;The matches fall into hoppers which measure the proper amount of matches for each box,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;45;The matches are dumped from the hoppers into the inner portions of the cardboard match boxes which are moving along a conveyor belt located below the hoppers,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;46;Ten or more boxes may be filled at the same time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Match;47;The outer portions of the match boxes move along another conveyor belt running parallel to the first belt,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;48;Both conveyors stop momentarily and the filled inner portions are pushed into the outer portions,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;49;This cycle of filling the inner portions and pushing them into the outer portions is repeated at a rate of about once per second,Relevant
MadeHow;Match;50;The filled match boxes are moved by conveyor belt to a machine which groups them and places them in a corrugated cardboard box for shipping,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;1;Metal hardware components are manufactured from steel or steel and zinc alloys using precision metalworking equipment such as lathes and drill presses,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;2;If the external body shell of an inexpensive microscope is plastic it is usually a light rigid plastic such as acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene (ABS) plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;3;ABS plastic components are made by injection molding,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;4;In this process the plastic is melted and forced under pressure into a mold in the shape of the final product,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;5;The plastic is then allowed to cool back into a solid,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;6;The mold is opened and the product is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;7;The proper raw materials for the type of optical glass desired are mixed in the proper proportions along with waste glass of the same type,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;8;This waste glass known as cullet acts as a flux,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;9;A flux is a substance which causes raw materials to react at a lower temperature than they would without it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;10;The mixture is heated in a glass furnace until it has melted into a liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;11;The temperature varies with the type of glass being made but is typically about 2550°F (1400°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;12;The temperature is raised to about 2800°F (1550°C) to force air bubbles to rise to the surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;13;It is then slowly cooled and stirred constantly until it has reached a temperature of about 1800°F (1000°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;14;The glass is now an extremely thick liquid which is poured into molds shaped like the lenses to be made,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;15;When the glass has cooled to about 600°F (300°C) it is reheated to about 1000°F (500°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;16;This process known as annealing removes internal stresses which form during the initial cooling period and which weaken the glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;17;The glass is then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;18;The pieces of glass are removed from the molds,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;19;They are now known as blanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;20;The blank is now placed in a vise and held beneath a rapidly rotating cylindrical cutter with a diamond blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;21;This cutter known as a curve generator trims the surface of the blank until a close approximation of the desired curve is obtained,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;22;The cut lens is inspected and cut again if necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;23;The difficulty of this process varies widely depending on the type of glass being cut and the exact curvature required,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;24;Several cuttings may be required and the time involved may be a few minutes or more than half an hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;25;Several cut blanks are placed on the surface of a curved block in such a way that their curved surfaces line up as if they were all part of one spherical surface,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;26;This allows many lenses to be ground at the same time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;27;A cast iron grinding surface known as a tool is placed on top on the lenses,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;28;The block of lenses rotates while the tool moves at random on top of it,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;29;A steady flow of liquid moves between the tool and the lenses,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;30;This liquid known as a slurry contains water an abrasive (usually silicon carbide) to do the grinding a coolant to prevent overheating and a surfactant to keep the abrasive from settling out of the slurry,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;31;The lenses are inspected after grinding and reground if necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;32;The grinding process may take one to eight hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;33;The lenses are moved to a polishing machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;34;This is similar to the grinding machine but the tool is made of pitch (a thick soft resin derived from tar),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;35;A pitch tool is made by placing tape around a curved dish pouring in hot liquid pitch and letting it cool back into a solid,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;36;A pitch tool can be used about 50 times before it must be reshaped,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;37;It works in the same manner as a grinding tool but instead of an abrasive the slurry contains a polishing substance (usually cerium dioxide),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;38;The lenses are inspected after polishing and the procedure is repeated as necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;39;Polishing may take from half an hour to five hours,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;40;The lenses are cleaned and ready to be coated,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;41;The lenses are coated with magnesium fluoride,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;42;They are then inspected again labeled with a date of manufacture and a serial number and stored until needed,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;43;If a mirror is included it is made in a way similar to the way in which a lens is made,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;44;Unlike a lens it is cut ground and polished to be flat rather than curved,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;45;A reflective coating is then applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;46;Aluminum is heated in a vacuum to produce a vapor,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;47;A negative electrostatic charge is applied to the surface of the mirror so that it attracts the positively charged aluminum ions,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;48;This allows a thin even coating of metal to be applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;49;A protective coating of silicon dioxide is then applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;50;Like a lens the mirror is inspected labeled and stored,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;51;All of the final assembly of the microscope is done by hand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;52;The workers wear gloves masks and gowns so that dirt does not damage the lenses or the internal mechanisms of the microscope,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;53;First the Microscopelenses are placed in the steel tubes which make up the bodies of the eyepiece and the objective,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;54;These tubes are manufactured in standard sizes which allow them to be assembled into a standard size microscope,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;55;The focusing mechanism of most microscopes is a rack and pinion system,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;56;This consists of a flat piece of metal with teeth on one side (the rack) and a metal wheel with teeth (the pinion) which controls the movement of the rack,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;57;The rack and pinion direct the objective so that its movement toward or away from the object being observed can be controlled,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;58;In many microscopes the rack and pinion are attached to the stage (the flat metal plate on which the object being observed rests) and the objective remains stationary,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;59;After the rack and pinion system is installed the knobs that control it are attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;60;The external body shell of the microscope is assembled around the internal focusing mechanism,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;61;The eyepiece (or two eyepieces for a binocular microscope) and objective (or a rotating disk containing several different objectives) are screwed into place,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;62;Eyepieces and objectives are manufactured in standard sizes that allow many different eyepieces and objectives to be used in any standard microscope,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;63;If the microscope contains a mirror this is attached to the body of the microscope below the opening in the stage,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;64;If it contains a light bulb instead this may be attached in the same place (to shine light through the observed object) or it may be placed to the side of the stage (to shine light on top of the object),Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;65;Some professional microscopes contain both kinds of light bulbs to allow both kinds of observation,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;66;If the microscope contains a camera it is attached to the top of the body,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Microscope;67;The microscope is tested,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;68;If it functions correctly the eyepiece and objective are usually unscrewed before packing,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;69;The parts of the microscope are packed securely in closefitting compartments lined with cloth or foam,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;70;These compartments are often part of a wood or steel box,Relevant
MadeHow;Microscope;71;The microscope is then placed in a strong cardboard container and shipped to consumers,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;1;The production of mosquito repellents can be broken down into two steps,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;2;First a large batch of the repellent formulation is made and then the batch is filled into the packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;3;Since aerosols are the most common form of mosquito repellent the following Mosquito Repellent description details their production,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;4;Other forms of repellents like creams and lotions are produced in a similar way except that the filling process is less involved,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;5;The first step in the manufacturing process is compounding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;6;In the compounding area raw materials are mixed together in large stainless steel tanks,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;7;For an aerosol the alcohol is pumped into the tank and the other materials including DEET fragrance and emollients are manually poured in and allowed to mix,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;8;All of the ingredients except the propellant are added at this phase of production,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;9;Since some of the materials in this process are flammable special precautions are taken to prevent explosion such as using sparkproof electrical outlets and blastproof walls,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;10;When the batch is finished a sample is sent to the quality control lab and tested to make sure it meets the set standards for the product,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;11;After passing these tests it is pumped to the filling lines to make the finished product,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;12;The filling line is a series of machines connected by a conveyor belt system that combine all of the components to make the finished mosquito repellent product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;13;The first machine in the system feeds the empty cans onto the conveyor line,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;14;This machine has a large hopper that is filled with empty Mosquito Repellentcans which are physically manipulated until they are standing upright and correctly oriented,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;15;The metal cans are then automatically moved along the conveyor belt and cleaned with a jet of compressed air to remove any dust and debris,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;16;They next travel to the filling carousel,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;17;The filling carousel is made up of a series of piston filling heads that are calibrated to deliver exactly the correct amount of product into the cans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;18;As the cans move through this section of the filling line they are filled with product,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;19;The next step in the filling process involves topping the cans with a valve adding the propellant and pressurizing the cans,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;20;The valve is put on by the valve inserter machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;21;Much like the bin that holds the empty cans the valves are also put in a hopper and then correctly sorted and aligned,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;22;As the cans pass by the valves are put on,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;23;These valves are then tightly affixed to the can by the valve crimping machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;24;Depending on the type of filling technique the propellant is either injected through the valve at high pressure or injected into the can before the valve is crimped,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;25;After the cans are capped and filled they are moved to a hot tank a long trough filled with hot water,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;26;Here the cans are checked for escaping bubbles that would indicate a propellant leak,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;27;The high temperature of the waterbath also raises the internal pressure of the can which is intended to cause any weak spots in the can to fail,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;28;This is a crucial quality control step that prevents damaged cans from being sold to the public,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;29;When the cans exit the waterbath they are dried by highpressure air jets,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;30;Other components are then added such as the actuating button and the overcap,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;31;Any needed labels or printing are also added at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;32;The finished cans are then moved to the boxing area where they are put into boxes typically a dozen cans at a time,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;33;These boxes are then stacked onto pallets and hauled away in large trucks to distributors,Relevant
MadeHow;Mosquito Repellent;34;High speed aerosol production lines like the one described can move at speeds of about 200 cans per minute or more,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;1;The exact manufacturing process depends on the type of patch being constructed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;2;In general patch membranes are made by one of several techniques all of which are designed to create a series of uniform diffusion pores,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;3;For example in the polymer precipitation method a polymer film is cast on a steel belt containing a solventwater mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;4;As the polymer film hardens the solvent evaporates and creates a multitude of tiny holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;5;Porous membranes can also be created by stretching a thin melted film of polymer,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;6;As the film is uniformly stretched small pores are formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;7;This method is typically used for Nicotine Patch polypropylene films,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;8;Polycarbonate films can be perforated by exposure to certain forms of nuclear particles,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;9;Regardless of the process the goal is to create a thin plastic membrane with a multitude of microscopic channels through which the drug can diffuse,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;10;These membranes can be attached to the plastic housing containing the drug in subsequent operations,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;11;In systems where the drug is intermingled with the patch material like the matrix type and the mixed adhesive type the process is somewhat different,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;12;The mixture is prepared in a special type of mixer known as a Hockenmeyer mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;13;The adhesive is added first and premixed at high speeds for a predetermined period of time,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;14;Next other additives such as viscosity control agents may be added and further mixing occurs,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;15;Then the drug component is slowly added and the mixing speed is increased,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;16;Final adjustments in pH or viscosity may be made at this point,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;17;Final processing depends on the type of carrier,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;18;Reservoir type patches must be filled with the drug mixture,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;19;The drugadhesive matrix described above is coated onto siliconetreated polyester film,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;20;The silicone ensures the patch can be easily removed to expose the adhesive layer,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;21;The completed patch is oven dried to remove solvents and then laminated to a carrier or backing strip,Relevant
MadeHow;Nicotine Patch;22;This backing strip can be further processed by die cutting and then packaged as a finished product,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;1;After the ripe olives have been combed from the trees they are picked over by hand to weed out unsound olives,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;2;The olives are divided into categories according to their plumpness state of ripeness and quality,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;3;Then the olives are taken to the press and stored for a short period of time from a few hours to several days,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;4;The period is short enough to prevent fermentation but long enough to allow the olives to get warm so that they release their oil easily,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;5;The olives are rinsed in cold water and then passed along a conveyer belt between rollers or continuous hammers,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;6;This machinery often called the olive crusher breaks down the cells and destones the olives,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;7;Depending on the resiliency of the olives skin and the stage of maturation it may be necessary to pass the fruit through the mill a second time,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;8;In ancient times the olives were mashed into a paste with a simple mortar and pestle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;9;This principle was expanded upon until the stone mortars were large enough to require slaves or pack animals to operate them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;10;In the modern process the milled olives travel from the mill into vats in which slowly turning blades mash the olives into a homogenized paste,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;11;The oil is extracted by loading the paste into a hydraulic press,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;12;The olive paste is evenly spread over hemp pressing bags or disks covered with synthetic fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;13;Each bag or disk is covered with approximately 913 lb (46 kg) of paste,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;14;Between 25 and 50 bags or disks are stacked onto a press plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;15;Plate guides are inserted at intervals of five to six bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;16;The plates serve to maintain the balance of the stack and to distribute the pressure evenly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;17;A piston pushes up against the stack and the oil seeps slowly through the pressing bags to attached tubes,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;18;The solid material remains inside the pressing bags,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;19;The term coldpressing refers to the fact that the oil is extracted without heating the paste furthering insuring the purity of the oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;20;The oil that is expressed is a reddish mixture of the oil and the inherent vegetable water,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;21;This is the oil that receives the appellation of extravirgin olive oil,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;22;The paste is removed from the bags and run through several more presses to obtain the lesser grades of oil that remain,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;23;Originally the oil and water mixture was stored in vats until the oil rose to the top and was skimmed off,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;24;Some fermentation was inevitable affecting the taste and smell of the olive oil,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;25;Today the separation is accomplished swiftly by pumping the mixture into a centrifuge,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;26;The centrifuge is comprised of a rotating drum and an auger that are spun on the same axis at great speed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;27;Because the oil and the vegetable water are of differing densities the centrifuge forces them apart and into separate receptacles,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;28;The oil is stored in underground vats until it is ready to be shipped,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;29;Then the oil is canned or bottled on an assembly line,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;30;Cans or darktinted bottles will keep the deepgreen color of the olive oil intact,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;31;Oil placed in clearglass bottles will fade to a yellowishgreen,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;32;However the flavor is not affected,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;33;In many cases olive oil distributors purchase the olive from the producers and rebottle it,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;34;Packaging has become more ornate as the popularity of olive oil has grown,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;35;It is not unusual to purchase olive oil in unusually shaped bottles topped with netting or rope,Relevant
MadeHow;Olive Oil;36;Some packagers also hire professional artists to design their labels,Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;1;Pacemakers are sophisticated electronic devices,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Pacemaker;3;The construction of a pacemaker is not a linear process but an integrated one,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;4;Component parts such as the battery leads and the circuitry are constructed individually then pieced together to form the final product,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;5;The primary type of battery used in pacemakers is a lithiumiodine cell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;6;One method used by manufacturers to make these batteries involves first mixing together the iodine and a polymer such as poly2vinylpyridine (PVP),Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;7;They are heated together forming a molten chargetransfer complex,Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;8;This liquid is then poured into a half moonshaped preformed cell which contains the other components of the battery including the lithium anode (positive charge) and a cathode collector screen,Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;9;The iodinepolymer blend solidifies as it cools to form the cathode,Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;10;After the cathode is formed the battery is hermetically sealed to prevent moisture from entering,Relevant
MadeHow;Pacemaker;11;The leads are typically composed of a metal alloy,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Paper Currency;1;In the United States all paper money is engraved and printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing which is part of the Department of the Treasury of the federal government,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;2;The Bureau also prints postage stamps savings bonds treasury notes and many other items,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;3;The main production facility is located in Washington DC and there is a smaller facility in Fort Worth Texas,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;4;Every day the Bureau prints approximately 38 million pieces of paper money,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;5;About 45 of this production are $1 bills and 25 are $20 bills,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;6;The rest of the production is divided between $5 $10 $50 and $100 bills,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;7;Although the $2 bill is still in circulation it is rarely used and therefore is rarely printed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;8;Each bill regardless of its denomination costs the government about 38 cents to produce,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;9;There are 65 separate operations in the production of paper money,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;10;Here are the major steps ,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;11;Engravers hand cut the design into a piece of soft steel known as the master die using very fine engraving tools and a magnifying glass,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;12;The portrait and images consist of numerous lines dots and dashes which are cut in various sizes and shapes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;13;The fine crosshatched lines in the background of the portrait are produced by a ruling machine and the scrollwork in the borders are cut using a geometric lathe,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;14;Every time a new Treasurer of the United States or a new Secretary of the Treasury is appointed their signatures must be engraved on a new master die for each denomination bill,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;15;First the signatures are photographically enlarged,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;16;An engraver then traces the signatures by hand with one end of a device known as a pantograph,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;17;This motion is mechanically reduced through a set of linkages causing several diamondtipped needles on the other end of the pantograph to cut the signatures into the master dies,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;18;Once the master die has been inspected it is heated and a thin plastic sheet is pressed into it to form a raised impression of the design,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;19;Thirtytwo of these raised plastic impressions are bonded together in a configuration of four across and eight down to form what is known as an alto,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;20;The master die is then placed in storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;21;The plastic alto is placed in an electrolytic plating tank and is plated with copper,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;22;The plastic is stripped away leaving a thin plate of metal known as a basso with 32 recessed impressions of the design,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;23;The metal basso is then cleaned polished and inspected,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;24;If it passes inspection it is plated with chromium to make the surface hard and it becomes a master printing plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;25;Printing the front and back of the bills 5 The principal printing process is known as intaglio printing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;26;This process is used because of its ability to produce extremely fine detail that remains legible under repeated handling and is difficult to counterfeit,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;27;A stack of 10000 sheets of paper is loaded into a highspeed rotary intaglio printing press,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;28;Each sheet is sized to allow 32 individual bills to be printed on the same sheet,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;29;The paper is inspected to ensure that it contains the proper security thread for the denomination to be printed,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;30;A master printing plate of the proper denomination is secured around the master plate cylinder in the press,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;31;The rotating master printing plate is coated with ink,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;32;A wiper removes the ink from the surface of the plate leaving only the ink that is trapped in the engraved recesses of the design,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;33;A sheet of paper is fed into the press where it passes between the master plate cylinder and a hard smooth impression cylinder under pressures reaching 15000 psi (1034 bar),Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;34;The impression cylinder forces the paper into the fine engraved lines of the printing plate to pick up the ink leaving a raised image about 00008 in (002 mm) above the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;35;This process is repeated at a rate of about 10000 sheets per hour,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;36;The printed sheets are then stacked on top of each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;37;The backs are printed with green ink first and are allowed to dry for 2448 hours before the fronts are printed with black ink,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;38;After the intaglio printing process the stacks are cut into two stacks of 10000 sheets and are visually examined for defects,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;39;Each sheet is fed into a letterpress which prints the colored Treasury seal and serial numbers on the face of the bills,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;40;Sixteen serial numbers are printed at the same time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;41;The press then automatically advances the numbers before the next sheet of sixteen is printed,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;42;The numbers on any sheet are separated by 20000 between adjacent bills,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;43;Thus the bill in the upper lefthand corner of the first sheet would be serial number 0000001 and the one below it on the same sheet would be 0020001 and so on,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;44;On the second sheet all the numbers would advance by one giving 0000002 in the upper left 0020002 below it etc,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;45;In this manner when the sheets are cut into separate stacks the bills within each stack will have sequential serial numbers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;46;The finished sheets are inspected with machine sensors and any printing errors folded paper inclusion of foreign objects or other defects are identified,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;47;Any bills which are found to be defective are marked for later removal,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;48;Such bills are replaced with star notes which are numbered in a different sequence and have a star printed after the serial number,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;49;The sheets are gathered in stacks of 100 and cut into 16 individual stacks of 100 bills each with a vertical guillotine knife,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;50;Any bills which have been identified as defective are replaced with star notes at this time,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;51;The stacks of 100 bills are then wrapped with a paper band,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;52;The banded stacks are given a final visual inspection and are shrinkwrapped with plastic in bundles of 10 stacks,Relevant
MadeHow;Paper Currency;53;Four of these 10stack bundles are then wrapped together to form a brick before they are shipped to the various federal reserve banks and other agencies,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;1;Steinways method of rim bending is still used and is the first step in assembling the grand piano,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Piano;3;Up to 22 layers form each piano rim and the layers may be up to 25 ft (762 m) long,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;4;Resin glue is applied by machine then the layers are carried to the press where they are shaped,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;5;The rims are stored in braces to keep them from changing shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;6;They are seasoned in controlled temperature and humidity conditions until the wood meets a specific moisture content where it will hold its contour,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;7;The bent inner rim is then fitted with other wood components including the cross block the pinblock the cross braces the keybed and the backbottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;8;These are glued and doweled in place,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;9;The cabinet is finished to improve sound properties as well as for appearance,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;10;The cabinet is sanded so stain is absorbed properly wood is bleached to equalize appearance of the veneer prestaining and staining are done next wood fillers (sometimes with a washcoat) are added and a first coat of sealer or lacquer is applied,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;11;The surface is sanded again special glazes (for antiquing or other effects) are added followed by two more coats of lacquer sanding is done again special trims are added and two final coats of lacquer are used,Relevant

MadeHow;Piano;13;The wood components of the piano (collectively called the framework)—the pinblock and the cast iron plate—are the parts of the piano that support the tension of the strings,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;14;Braces are made of select spruce and the pinblock or wrestplank is constructed of bonded layers of rock maple,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;15;The pinblock is quartersawn or rotary cut to maximize the grain structures grip on the tuning pins,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;16;The laminated layers are also glued at different angles to each other so that the pins are surrounded with end grain wood,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;17;The pinblock has one hole per string or up to 240 holes drilled in it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;18;The cast iron plate is made in a piano plate foundry,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;19;Matchplates are made of metal from the wood pattern designed by the engineer with top and bottom pieces to match,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;20;Sand molds are made from the matchplates and these are used to cast the plate,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;21;Molten iron is poured through the molds and allowed to harden during the founding process (a controlled cooling process) to produce a plate weighing about 600 lb (2724 kg),Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;22;After the plate is cooled and removed from the molds sand is blasted off the plate with steel grit,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;23;The plate is transported on overhead conveyors to a drill room where holes are drilled for the tuning pins nosebolts bolts to the frame and hitch pins,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;24;The hitch pins are inserted next then the casting imperfections are removed from the plate by grinding and drilling,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;25;Oils are also removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;26;The plate is handsanded and rubbed primed and painted,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;27;The cast iron plate is suspended above its piano during the process of fitting,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;28;The plate will be lowered and raised in and out of the piano several times as the pinblock seal against the rim and the soundboard and bridges are fitted,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;29;The soundboard is a thin panel of spruce that underlies the strings and the cast iron plate and rests on the rim braces,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;30;Its parts are the board itself supporting ribs on the underside of the board and the two bridges over which the strings are stretched,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;31;The soundboard is made of spruce that is 0250375 in (0635095 cm) thick it acts as a natural resonator is strong for its weight and can be vibrated by the strings because of its lightness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;32;Spruce is air dried then kiln dried to a specific moisture content,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;33;It is then cut into strips that are 25 in (5445387 cm) wide the edges are glued and the strips are pressed together and dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;34;A pattern is superimposed and the soundboard is trimmed to grand piano size,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;35;The soundboard is curved to produce the right sound,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;36;The curve is called a crown that arches upward toward the strings,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;37;The arch is made by fitting ribs of lightweight spruce or sugar pine wood to the underside of the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;38;The ribs are carefully cut from patterns then fitted and glued to the soundboard using a rib press that accurately positions the ribs then forces the board into the proper curvature,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;39;The ribs are cut along the woods lengthwise grain and fitted at right angles to the lengthwise grain of the soundboard so that vibrations are evenly transmitted,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;40;The ends of the ribs are feathered then fitted into notches in the framework of the piano that will exactly support the arch of the crown the pianomakers use special patterns to guide these cuts in the frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;41;The two soundboard bridges transfer the vibrations of the strings along their lengths to the soundboard,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;42;The long bridge is crossed by treble strings and the bass strings that fan across the trebles cross the short bridge,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;43;The bridges are complicated because they must parallel the grain of the soundboard closely curve with the crown and support the strings which exert a downbearing pressure on the bridges and therefore on the soundboard,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;44;This pressure must be supported by the strength of the bridges and the arch of the crown or the tone of the strings will drop,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;45;The bridges are made of solid blocks of wood or of laminated wood,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;46;Hard maple is used in Americanmade pianos and falcon wood (beech) is used in Europe,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;47;Laminated bridges must be placed with laminations perpendicular to the soundboard or the glue layers have a damping effect,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Piano;48;The bridges are glued to the soundboard and also fastened to it with wood screws capped by soundboard buttons made of wood that act like washers and keep the screws from grinding into the board,Relevant
MadeHow;Piano;49;The bridges are notched on both sides where each string crosses so the string strikes a small part of the bridge and can vibrate easily,Relevant

MadeHow;Sand;1;The preparation of sand consists of five basic processes natural decomposition extraction sorting washing and in some cases crushing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;2;The first process natural decomposition usually takes millions of years,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;3;The other processes take considerably less time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;4;The processing plant is located in the immediate vicinity of the natural deposit of material to minimize the costs of transportation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;5;If the plant is located next to a sand dune or beach the plant may process only sand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;6;If it is located next to a riverbed it will usually process both sand and gravel because the two materials are often intermixed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;7;Most plants are stationary and may operate in the same location for decades,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;8;Some plants are mobile and can be broken into separate components to be towed to the quarry site,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;9;Mobile plants are used for remote construction projects where there are not any stationary plants nearby,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;10;The capacity of the processing plant is measured in tons per hour output of finished product,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Sand;14;In many locations an asphalt production plant or a ready mixed concrete plant operates on the same site as the sand and gravel plant,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;15;In those cases much of the sand and gravel output is conveyed directly into stockpiles for the asphalt and concrete plants,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;16;Solid rock is broken down into chunks by natural mechanical forces such as the movement of glaciers the expansion of water in cracks during freezing and the impacts of rocks falling on each other,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;17;The chunks of rock are further broken down into grains by the chemical action of vegetation and rain combined with mechanical impacts as the progressively smaller particles are carried and worn by wind and water,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;18;As the grains of rock are carried into waterways some are deposited along the bank while others eventually reach the sea where they may join with fragments of coral or shells to form beaches,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;19;Windborne sand may form dunes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;20;Extraction of sand can be as simple as scooping it up from the riverbank with a rubbertired vehicle called a front loader,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;21;Some sand is excavated from under water using floating dredges,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;22;These dredges have a long boom with a rotating cutter head to loosen the sand deposits and a suction pipe to suck up the sand,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;23;If the sand is extracted with a front loader it is then dumped into a truck or train or placed onto a conveyor belt for transportation to the nearby processing plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;24;If the sand is extracted from underwater with a dredge the slurry of sand and water is pumped through a pipeline to the plant,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;25;In the processing plant the incoming material is first mixed with water if it is not already mixed as part of a slurry and is discharged through a large perforated screen in the feeder to separate out rocks lumps of clay sticks and other foreign material,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;26;If the material is heavily bound together with clay or soil it may then pass through a blade mill which breaks it up into smaller chunks,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;27;The material then pass through several perforated screens or plates with different hole diameters or openings to separate the particles according to size,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;28;The screens or plates measure up to 10 ft (31 m) wide by up to 28 ft (85 m) long and are tilted at an angle of about 2045 degrees from the horizontal,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;31;They are vibrated to allow the trapped material on each level to work its way off the end of the screen and onto separate conveyor belts,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;32;The coarsest screen with the largest holes is on top and the screens underneath have progressively smaller holes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;33;The material that comes off the coarsest screen is washed in a log washer before it is further screened,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;34;The name for this piece of equipment comes from the early practice of putting short lengths of wood logs inside a rotating drum filled with sand and gravel to add to the scrubbing action,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;35;A modern log washer consists of a slightly inclined horizontal trough with slowly rotating blades attached to a shaft that runs down the axis of the trough,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;36;The blades churn through the material as it passes through the trough to strip away any remaining clay or soft soil,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;37;The larger gravel particles are separated out and screened into different sizes while any smaller sand particles that had been attached to the gravel may be carried back and added to the flow of incoming material,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;38;The material that comes off the intermediate screen(s) may be stored and blended with either the coarser gravel or the finer sand to make various aggregate mixes,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;39;The water and material that pass through the finest screen is pumped into a horizontal sand classifying tank,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;40;As the mixture flows from one end of the tank to the other the sand sinks to the bottom where it is trapped in a series of bins,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;41;The larger heavier sand particles drop out first followed by the progressively smaller sand particles while the lighter silt particles are carried off in the flow of water,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;42;The water and silt are then pumped out of the classifying tank and through a clarifier where the silt settles to the bottom and is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;43;The clear water is recirculated to the feeder to be used again,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;44;The sand is removed from the bins in the bottom of the classifying tank with rotating dewatering screws that slowly move the sand up the inside of an inclined cylinder,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;45;The differently sized sands are then washed again to remove any remaining silt and are transported by conveyor belts to stockpiles for storage,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;46;Some sand is crushed to produce a specific size or shape that is not available naturally,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Sand;47;The crusher may be a rotating cone type in which the sand falls between an upper rotating cone and a lower fixed cone that are separated by a very small distance,Relevant
MadeHow;Sand;48;Any particles larger than this separation distance are crushed between the heavy metal cones and the resulting particles fall out the bottom,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;1;A special type of steel alloyed with tungsten is produced and rolled into strips,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;2;The thickness of the strip sets the thickness of the finished blade and is gauged by the same instruments used to measure wires,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;3;The blades are then stamped out of the alloyed steel using stamping machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;4;The overall shape of the handsaw blade narrows from handle to tip,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;5;The best saws have a crown or curved cutting edge rather than a straight one so fewer teeth are in contact with the surface of the wood at any given time while the saw is in motion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;6;Most inexpensive handsaws are of a uniform thickness,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;7;The blade is then processed according to standards for optimal use,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;8;Depending on the type of saw different techniques may be applied,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;9;The crosscut saw for instance is bevel filed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;10;The back of a handsaw is ground thinner than the toothed edge to reduce friction during use,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;11;Handsaws are generally taper ground,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;12;The set or adjustment of the blades teeth is crucial to the saws effectiveness Saw so teeth are measured with a gauge made of plate steel that analyses three teeth at a time,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;13;Then they are cut and bent in altemating directions,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;14;Too much angling away from each other however results in a saw that does not cut properly,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;15;Hardening comes next,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;16;The classic technique used for centuries includes hammering the blade to render it tensioned so it displays the best combination of stiffness and flexibility,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;17;Many variations are possible,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;18;Today professional hacksaws are hardened throughout while those intended for home use have only their teeth hardened,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Saw;19;A coating of rust protection is sprayed on the hardened saw blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Saw;20;Finally the blades are fastened to separately made injectionmolded handles,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;1;Before they are sharpened and attached the two halves of a pair of scissors are known as blanks,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;2;A blank may consist of a blade and a handle in one piece or it may consist of only the blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;3;In the latter case a metal handle will be welded to the blade or a plastic handle will be attached to it,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;4;Inexpensive scissors may be made from blanks formed by cold stamping,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;5;In this process a sharp die in the shape of the blank is stamped into a sheet of unheated steel,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;6;The die cuts through the steel to form the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;7;Blanks may also be made by molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;8;O Molten steel is poured into a mold in the shape of the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;9;The steel cools back into a solid and the blank is removed,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;10;Most quality scissors are made from blanks formed by drop forging,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;11;Like cold stamping this process involves shaping the blanks with a die,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;12;This die known as a drop hammer pounds into a bar of redhot steel to form the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;13;The pressure of the drop hammer also strengthens the steel,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;14;The blanks are trimmed to the proper shape by cutting away excess metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;15;A hole is drilled through the blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;16;This hole will later allow two completed blades to be attached to each other,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;17;The trimmed blanks are hardened by heating them then cooling them quickly in cold air water oil or another substance,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;18;The temperature to which they are heated and the medium in which they are cooled varies depending on the type of steel from which they are made and the desired characteristics of the blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;19;The hardened blanks are heated again and allowed to cool slowly in air,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;20;This second heating known as tempering gives the blank a uniform hardness,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;21;If the blades of a pair of scissors did not have uniform hardness the harder places on one blade would soon wear out the softer places on the other blade,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;22;The repeated heating and cooling causes the blanks to warp,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;23;They are straightened by being placed on an anvil and lightly tapped with a hammer,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;24;This process is known as peening,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;25;The blank is ground into a blade by applying the edge to a rapidly moving sanding belt or abrasive wheel,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;26;The surface of the belt or wheel is covered with small particles of an abrasive substance and works in the same way as sandpaper,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;27;The hard abrasive grinds away enough steel to form a sharp edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;28;During this process the blade is cooled with water or various liquids known as cutting fluids to prevent it from heating and warping,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;29;The sharpened blade is then polished in a similar manner using belts or wheels containing much smaller particles of abrasive,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;30;For many scissors the handles are I 0 formed from the start as part of the blank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;31;If not they may be made of a metal alloy or from plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;32;If they are metal they are made in the same way as the blanks and then welded to them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;33;If they are plastic they are made by injection molding,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;34;In this process molten plastic is forced under pressure into a mold in the shape of the handles,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;35;It is allowed to cool and the mold is opened to remove the handles,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;36;The handles contain hollow slots into which the end of the blanks can be inserted,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scissors;37;A strong adhesive is used to keep the handle firmly attached,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;38;Two polished blades are attached to each other by a rivet or screw through the previously drilled holes,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;39;Rivets which cannot be adjusted by the consumer are used to make less expensive scissors,Relevant
MadeHow;Scissors;40;Adjustable screws are used in more costly scissors,Relevant

MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;1;The microencapsulation process is done in a large vat or kettle called a reactor,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;2;First scented oil is added to a solution of watersoluble polymer in the reactor,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;3;At this stage the oil and water do not mix and are separate like oil and vinegar in a salad dressing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;4;Then the mixture is blended at high speed by means of a rotary blade,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;5;This part of the process is called high shear agitation,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;6;As the rotor blade mixes the oil and water the oil breaks down into very small beads or droplets,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;7;After about 12 hours of agitation the beads reach the size of from 20 to 30 microns,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;8;At this size the individual beads are not visible to the naked eye and their width is less than the diameter of a human hair,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;9;First scented oil is added to a solution of watersoluble polymer in a reactor,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;10;Then the mixture is blended at high speed by means of a rotary blade until the beads of oil are very small,Relevant

MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;13;Microencapsulated scents may be applied to paper in different ways,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;14;To make scratch and sniff papers the slurry of capsules and water can be silkscreened,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;15;When the beads have reached the proper size the agitation is stopped and a chemical catalyst is added,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;16;The catalyst causes the molecular weight of the polymer to increase and the polymer becomes water insoluble,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;17;The polymer then precipitates out of the water and rains down on the oil droplets,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;18;The precipitate forms a plastic (or gelatin) shell around each individual oil bead,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;19;The oil beads have been encapsulated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;20;At this point the reaction is stopped,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;21;The next step is to remove the capsules from the reactor and wash them,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;22;The capsules are removed to a belt which moves them through a spray of water,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;23;The scratch and sniff capsules are washed only once whereas perfume capsules are washed twice,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;24;The washed capsules are then loaded into a tank and mixed with a water base,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;25;A thick slurry is formed,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;26;For scratch and sniff adhesives are added to the slurry,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;27;At this point the slurry can be applied to paper using a variety of printing processes,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;30;Scratch and sniff is often used for stickers and these are usually produced through a type of printing known as flexographic printing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;31;The strips of fragrance commonly used in advertisements are produced by extrusion,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;32;The fragrance is extruded onto paper in a process similar to the way adhesive is extruded onto tape,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;33;The extrusion process is complex and requires stateoftheart printing equipment,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;34;Usually presses capable of handling perfume strip printing have advanced computer controls,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;35;To produce the fragrance strip the paper has to be pretreated with a base coat of special waterbased adhesive which is extruded through pumps on the printer,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;36;Then the base coat must be dried in an oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;37;After drying the slurry of microencapsulated perfume is extruded onto the strip,Relevant
MadeHow;Scratch and Sniff;38;In order to make fragrance strips precut papers are pretreated with a base coat of special waterbased adhesive which is extruded through pumps on the printer,Relevant

MadeHow;Screw;1;Machining is only used on unique designs or with screws too small to be made any other way,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;2;The machining process is exact but too time consuming wasteful and expensive,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;3;The bulk of all screws are mass manufactured using the thread rolling method and that is the procedure described in further detail,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;4;Wire is fed from a mechanical coil through a prestraightening machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;5;The straightened wire flows directly into a machine that automatically cuts the wire at a designated length and die cuts the head of the screw blank into a preprogrammed shape,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;6;The heading machine utilizes either an open or closed die that either requires one punch or two punches to create the screw head,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;7;The closed (or solid) die creates a more accurate screw blank,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;8;On average the cold heading machine produces 100 to 550 screw blanks per minute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;9;Once cold headed the screw blanks are automatically fed to the threadcutting dies from a vibrating hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;10;The hopper guides the screw blanks down a chute to the dies while making sure they are in the correct feed position,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;11;The blank is then cut using one of three techniques,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;12;In the reciprocating die two flat dies are used to cut the screw thread,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;13;One die is stationary while the other moves in a reciprocating manner and the screw blank is rolled between the two,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;14;When a centerless cylindrical die is used the screw blank is rolled between two to three round dies in order to create the finished thread,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;15;The final method of thread rolling is the planetary rotary die process,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Screw;18;In the reciprocal method the screw blank is rolled between two dies,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;19;In the cylindrical method it is turned in the center of several rollers,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;20;All three methods create higher quality screws than the machinecut variety,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;21;This is because the thread is not literally cut into the blank during the threadrolling process rather it is impressed into the blank,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Screw;22;Thus no metal material is lost and weakness in the metal is avoided,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;23;The threads are also more precisely positioned,Relevant
MadeHow;Screw;24;The more productive of the threadrolling techniques is by far the planetary rotary die which creates screws at a speed of 60 to 2000 parts per minute,Relevant

MadeHow;Teddy Bear;8;Finally the bears are pulled right side out and dispatched to be stuffed,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;9;The volume a worker produces depends on the type of bear one may produce 35 to 45 baby bears in one day or eight or nine larger species,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;10;The stitched bear is then stuffed,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;11;The manufacturer purchases polyester fiber in 500 lb (227 kg) bales in which the fiber is tightly packed,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;12;The fiber is dual density with a very fine fiber and a thicker slightly wavy fiber together these fibers have the most desirable packing quality for stuffing animals,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;13;Because the polyester comes so tightly packed batches of it are tossed into a picker which is a barrel lined with spikes that fluffs the stuffing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;14;The fluffed material is blown by air into a stuffing machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;15;These machines have evolved little since World War H when the machines were used to stuff flight jackets for the United States Navy and Army Air Force,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;16;Air pressure blows the stuffing into the bear through a small diameter tube,Relevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;17;The operator can manipulate the bear to direct the stuffing to various parts of the toy,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;18;A pedal release on the stuffing machine controls the puffs of stuffing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Teddy Bear;19;Two pushes on the pedal for example may be needed to pump enough stuffing from the machines nozzle into the nose of the bear which needs to be firm,Irrelevant

MadeHow;Vitamin;12;In wet granulation the fine vitamin powder is mixed with a variety of cellulose particles Vitamin then wetted,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;13;The mixture is then dried in a dryer,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;14;After drying the formula may be in chunks as large as a dime,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;15;These chunks are sized by being run through a mill,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;16;The mill forces the chunks through a small hole of the desired diameter of the granule,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;17;These granules can then be weighed and mixed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;18;When all the vitamin ingredients are ready a worker takes them to the weigh station and weighs them out on a scale,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;19;The required weights for each ingredient in the batch are listed on a formula batch record,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;20;After weighing the worker dumps all the ingredients into a mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;21;The volume of a typical mixer may be from 1530 cu ft (042084 cu m) though in a large manufacturing facility it may be many times that large,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;22;The ingredients spend from 15 to 30 minutes in the mixer,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;23;At this point samples are taken from different sides of the mixer and checked in the laboratory,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;24;The lab technicians verify that all the ingredients are distributed in the same proportion throughout the mix,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;25;If the manufacturer is making a large batch workers may check the first three or four lots in the mixer and then only recheck periodically,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;26;After mixing is complete workers take the vitamin formula to either an encapsulating or a tabletmaking machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;27;If the lot in the mixer has been approved workers tote the mixture to the encapsulating machine and dump it in a hopper,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;28;At the beginning of a batch workers will testrun the encapsulating machine and check that the capsules are the proper and consistent weight,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;29;Workers also check the capsules visually to see if they seem to be splitting or dimpling,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;30;If the test batches run correctly workers run the entire batch,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;31;The vitamin mixture flows through one hopper and another hopper holds whole gelatin capsules,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;32;The capsules are broken into halves by the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;33;The bottom half of the capsule falls through a funnel into a rotating dosing dish,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;34;Then the machine measures a precise amount of the powdered vitamin mixture into each open capsule half,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;35;Tamping pins push the powder down,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;36;Then the top halves of the capsules are pushed down onto the filled bottoms,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;37;The finished vitamin mixture can be compressed into tablets sometimes with a coating or encapsulated in preformed gelatin capsules,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;38;The filled vitamin capsules are next run through a polishing machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;39;The vitamins are circulated on a belt through a series of soft brushes,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;40;Any excess dust or vitamin powder is removed from the exterior of the capsules by the brushes,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;41;The polished capsules are then poured onto an inspection table,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;42;The inspection table has a belt of rotating rods,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;43;The vitamins fall in the grooves between the rods and the vitamins rotate as the rods turn,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;44;Thus all sides of the vitamin are visible for the inspector to see,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;45;The inspector removes any capsules that are too long split dimpled or otherwise imperfect,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;46;The vitamins that pass inspection are then taken over to the packaging area,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;47;Vitamin tablets are made in a tableting machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;48;After the vitamin blend has been mixed in the mixer workers dump it into a hopper above the machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;49;The vitamin powder then flows through the hopper to a filling station beneath and flows from there to a rotating table,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;50;The rotating table may be 24 ft (0612m) in diameter or even bigger and is fitted with holes on its outside edge that hold dies in the shape of the desired tablet (oval round animal etc),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;51;The dies are interchangeable so the same table can produce whatever shape the manufacturer wishes as long as the proper dies are installed,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;52;The vitamin powder flows from the filling station to fill the die,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;53;When the table rotates the filled die moves into a punch press,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;54;When the upper and lower halves of the punch meet 410 tons (369 metric tons) of pressure is exerted on the vitamin powder,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;55;The pressure compresses the vitamin powder into a compact tablet,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;56;The punch releases and the lower punch lifts to eject the tablet,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;57;Some tableting machines may have two punches one on each side so two tablets are made simultaneously,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;58;The speed of the rotation of the table determines how many tablets are made per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;59;The tablets eject onto a vibrating belt which vibrates any loose dust off the tablets,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;60;The tablets then are moved to the coating area,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;61;Vitamin tablets are usually coated for a variety of reasons,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;62;The coating may make the tablet easier to swallow,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;63;It may mask an unpleasant taste and it may give the tablet a pleasant color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;64;A manufacturer may coat in two different colors tablets that are the same size and shape for identification,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;65;Tablets may also be given an enteric coating—a pH sensitive chemical coating that resists gastric acid,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;66;Tablets with an enteric coating will not break open in the stomach but move to the intestine before dissolving,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;67;Other coatings determine the timing of the tablets dissolution so the vitamins can be absorbed slowly or all at once depending on what is appropriate to that tablet,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;68;Once the tablets are taken from the tableting area they are placed in the coating pan,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;69;The coating pan is a large rotating pan surrounded by one to six spray guns operated by pumps,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;70;As the tablets revolve in the pan the pumps spray coating over them,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;71;Many tablets also receive a second coating of carnauba wax,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;72;After air drying the tablets are ready for packaging,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;73;The packaging step is the same for tablets as for capsules,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;74;Packaging the vitamins takes several steps and different machines carry out these steps,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;75;So in the packaging area the vitamins pass through a row of machines,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;76;Once the vitamins are dumped in the hopper of the first machine no human touches them,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;77;The worker sets the machine to count out the required number of capsules or tablets per bottle and the rest is done automatically,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;78;The capsules or tablets fall into a bottle and the bottle is passed to the next machine to be sealed capped labelled and shrinkwrapped,Relevant
MadeHow;Vitamin;79;The finished bottles are then set in boxes and are ready for distribution,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;1;Ground wood sheets of paper are produced by using an entire tree removing the bark and pressing the tree against a revolving tread which grinds the wood into slurry,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;2;The slurry is used to make a ground wood sheet—a relatively inexpensive wallpaper backing,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;3;Wood pulp sheets are made by debarking a tree and chipping the tree into a slurry,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;4;The mixture is run through a pulp mill where chlorine dioxide and oxygen are added to separate the lignin (which cements the woody cell walls together) from the rest of the wood pulp and bleaches the pulp,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;5;Wood pulp sheets with fibers can have synthetic fibers added to give the paper additional texture,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;6;A roll of paper from the paper mill is 65 in (165 m) wide possibly as long as 22000 ft (6706 m) and weighs approximately one ton,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;7;Once sold to a printer each paper roll is cut into six subrolls which are 21 in (53 cm) wide by 10000 ft (3048 m) long,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;8;Before the pattern is printed the backing must be coated with a ground color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;9;Ground wood sheets are coated with colored vinyl (PVC) which varies in thickness depending on the durability and strippability of paper under production,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;10;Vinyl may also be laminated to backings for exceptional serviceability,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;11;Wood pulp sheets are coated with one or all of the following kaolin clay for drapability titanium dioxide for opacity and latex for ease in handling and color,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;12;Metal rollers impregnated with a raised rubber pattern are mounted on a single machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;13;Ink is applied to the surface roller and the ink lays in the hills or rubber pattern sitting above the surface of the roller,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;14;The ink is then pressed onto the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;15;Each color of the pattern is printed with a single roller,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;16;Copper cylinders are laseretched then chromeplated for durability,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;17;Large gravureprinting machines hold a maximum of 12 cylinders that together create the whole pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;18;The paper roll moves to one cylinder a back roller picks up color and pushes it against an engraved roller,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;19;A steel doctor blade pushes against the engraved cylinder forcing ink into the etched detail,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;20;A rubber roller then presses paper against the cylinder enabling it to pick up the ink in the valleys of the engraving,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;21;Finally rollers carry the paper away from the cylinder into a dryer where the ink is set,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;22;Once the ink is dry the process begins again with the next cylinder,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;23;Stencils for each color present in the pattern are created from silk mesh screen using a photographic process,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;24;First a photographic negative is made of the pattern,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;25;Then a silk screen approximately 36 in (91 cm) long is stretched taut over a magnesium or wood frame,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;26;The screen is coated with a light sensitive emulsion and the negative is placed on top of the screen,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;27;Once hit with bright light the emulsion hardens in the areas not covered by the negative forming a stencil,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;28;Patterns can be printed onto wallpaper by one of several printing methods including gravure printing rotary printing and silkscreen printing,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;29;Paper is set upon a long table a screen stencil is placed on top and ink is applied by a scraper or squeegee,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;30;Color is deposited on the paper where the screen permits the ink to pass through to the paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;31;The stencil is picked up moved down the paper and inked again along the entire length of the paper roll,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;32;Before the next color is applied the ink is thoroughly dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;33;Each screen is carefully put down with blocks guides etc,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;34;so that the pattern is aligned and repeats without breaks,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;35;Hand printing produces patterns with thick evenly applied color,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;36;Theoretically the number of colors used in the screening process is limitless however the high cost of hand printing necessarily limits the number of colors companies can include in the pattern,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;37;This type of printing process combines the mechanics of gravure printing with the precision of photographically produced stencils,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;38;Mesh stencils are wrapped around hollow tubes mounted within a machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;39;Ink continuously flows through the filmwrapped tubes and onto paper imparting a tremendous amount of color (a maximum of 12 colors),Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;40;This technique resembles the more expensive silkscreening but it can print much more quickly—approximately 80 yd (7312 m) of wallpaper per minute,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;41;Printed wallpaper is rolled with a wet cornstarch or wheat starchbased coating and then dried,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;42;Residentialuse wallpapers are cut down from 3000 yd (2742 m) rolls to 15 yd (1371 m) rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;43;Commercialuse rolls are generally packaged in 30 45 and 60 yd (27 41 and 55 m) rolls,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;44;A printed label run number and hanging instructions are placed against each roll and shrink wrapped together,Relevant
MadeHow;Wallpaper ;45;Rolls are stored in a warehouse until final shipment,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;1;The following description reflects the making of a full customfitted handtied humanhair wig,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;2;Such a wig would take four to eight weeks to make and would sell for approximately $2000 to $4000,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;3;The wigmaker must first make sure that the individual hairs are lying in the same direction,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;4;This is done by holding a small bunch of hair in the hand and rubbing the ends between the finger and thumb,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;5;The tips (uncut ends) turn back during the rubbing while the cut ends (which were closer to the hairs root) lie straight,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;6;If the hairs in the bunch are running in both directions they must be turned by sorting the root down hairs into one pile and the root up hairs into another before recombining them into a single organized bunch,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;7;Very short hairs less than 3 in (75 cm) long are separated out by drawing the bunch through a hackle (wire brush) that is clamped to the workbench,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;8;After hackling the usable hairs are tied together into bundles of convenient size,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;9;Fine string is used to tie the bundles tight enough to hold them securely but loose enough to allow the string to be shifted while washing the hair,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;10;The hair is carefully inspected for nits (louse eggs),Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;11;If any are found they are removed by boiling the hair in an acetic acid solution and combing it through a steeltoothed nitting machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;12;Each bundle of hair is gently but thoroughly hand washed in a bowl of hot soapy water that contains a disinfectant,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;13;The hair is then rinsed several times in clear water,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;14;The bundles are carefully squeezed in a towel and allowed to dry either in open air or in an oven set at 176°212°F(80°100°C),Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;15;Bundles of clean dry hair are again hackled to straighten them,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;16;They are then passed through a set of drawing brushes so the wigmaker can sort them into bunches of equal length which are tied near the root end,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;17;If desired hair can now be permanently curled or waved,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;18;After the hair is wound onto curlers it is boiled in water for 15 to 60 minutes (depending on the tightness desired) and then dried in a warm oven for 24 hours or more,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;19;Heads of growing hair are not uniform in color,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;20;The wigmaker may prepare hair for a specific wig by blending as many as five or more slightly different shades of hair together to produce a more natural look,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;21;In order to get the best possible fit the foundation of a custom wig is made as close as possible to the shape of the clients head,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;22;This can be accomplished either by measuring several aspects of the head directly or by making a plaster cast of the head and using it as a model,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;23;Six basic measurements are taken of the customers head,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;24;The circumference is measured a half inch (127 cm) above the hairline at the nape of the neck above each ear and across the front of the head a half Wiginch (127 cm) above the hairline,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;25;For adults this measurement ranges from 1924 in (4861 cm),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;26;The second measurement is from the hairline at the front of the head to the hairline at the nape of the neck,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;27;The third is taken between points just in front of each ear along the hairline at the front of the head,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;28;The fourth goes across the crown of the head from just above one ear to just above the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;29;The fifth runs straight across the back of the head from one temple to the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;30;Finally the sixth measurement traces the nape of the neck,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;31;In addition the wigmaker must note such information as any unusual shape of the head the length and location of any desired parting of the hair and the desired style of the hair on the finished wig,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;32;A pattern is drawn and cut from lightcolored paper,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;33;The edge of the wigs foundation is cut from finemesh silk netting that matches the desired hair color,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;34;This piece varies in width from two or more inches (5 cm) in the front to one inch (25 cm) in the back,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;35;The crown of the foundation is cut from a coarser net made of silk cotton or nylon,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;36;If a part is to be incorporated in the wig a strip of very fine silk net (white or fleshcolored) is cut and inserted in the appropriate location on the foundation,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;37;The paper pattern is carefully positioned on an appropriate size block (a wooden headshaped form),Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;38;With this paper lying under the net foundation the mesh of the net is easier to see and knotting is facilitated,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;39;The pieces of the net foundation are joined together on the block by sewing them to pieces of galloon (fine strong silk ribbon that matches the color of the foundation netting),Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;40;The foundation is held in place on the block by cotton thread sewn through the galloon and laced through anchoring points (steel loops hammered into the block),Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;41;Springs sewn into the foundation at strategic locations will hold the completed Wigwig in place on the customers head,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;42;These devices 152 in (3851 cm) long are often made from steel watch springs or elastic bands and are encased in galloon,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;43;Hairs are attached to the net foundation by a procedure called knotting,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;44;Although various wigmakers use at least three types of knotting the single or full V knot is the most common,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;45;It is similar to the knot used in making a latchhook rug,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;46;Using this knot hairs 25 in (635 cm) long must be used to make a wig with 12 in (305 cm) long hair,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;47;Different sizes of ventilating needles can be used depending on the number of hairs that are to be tied together in one knot,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;48;Along parts and the front edges of the wig knots are usually made with single hairs while in the crown up to eight hairs may be knotted together,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;49;A full wig requires 30000 to 40000 knots which take a total of about 40 hours of tying,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Wig;50;When the wig is fully ventilated (ie all the hair is attached) it is removed from the wooden block and mounted wrongsideout on a soft block made of canvas stuffed with sawdust,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;51;A final row of knotting is done around the edge,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;52;The inside surface of the wig is pressed with a heated iron to secure the knots,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;53;The completed wig is pinned to a soft block for styling,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;54;The hair is gently dampened by combing through with a wet comb,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;55;Curls are formed as pincurls or on rollers or cotton forms,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;56;The wig is covered with a net and dried in a warm oven,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;57;The curls are then unpinned and the hair is combed and styled,Relevant
MadeHow;Wig;58;A net is carefully placed over the finished style and the wig is returned to the oven to set the style,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;1;There are three major spinning processes cotton worsted or longstaple or wool,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;2;Synthetic staple fibers can be made with any of these processes,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;3;Since more yarn is produced with the cotton process than the other two its manufacture is described below,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;4;Fibers are shipped in bales which are opened by hand or machine,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;5;Natural fibers may require cleaning whereas synthetic fibers only require separating,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;6;The picker loosens and separates the lumps of fiber and also cleans the fiber if necessary,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;7;Blending of different staple fibers may be required for certain applications,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;8;Blending may be done during formation of the lap during carding or during drawing out,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;9;Quantities of each fiber are measured carefully and their proportions are consistently maintained,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;10;The carding machine is set with hundreds of fine wires that separate the fibers and pull them into somewhat parallel form,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;11;A thin web of fiber is formed and as it moves along it passes through a funnelshaped device that produces a ropelike strand of parallel fibers,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;12;Blending can take place by joining laps of different fibers,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;13;When a smoother finer yarn is required fibers are subjected to a further paralleling method,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;14;A comblike device arranges fibers into parallel form with short fibers falling out of the strand,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;15;After carding or combing the fiber mass is referred to as the sliver,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;16;Several slivers are combined before this process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;17;A series of rollers rotating at different rates of speed elongate the sliver into a single more uniform strand that is given a small amount of twist and fed into large cans,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;18;Carded slivers are drawn twice after carding,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;19;Combed slivers are drawn once before combing and twice more after combing,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;20;The sliver is fed through a machine called the roving frame where the strands of fiber are further elongated and given additional twist,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;21;These strands are called the roving,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;22;The predominant commercial systems of yarn formation are ring spinning and openend spinning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;23;In ring spinning the roving is fed from the spool through rollers,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;24;These rollers elongate the roving which passes through the eyelet moving down and through the traveler,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;25;The traveler moves freely around the stationary ring at 4000 to 12000 revolutions per minute,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;26;The spindle turns the bobbin at a constant speed,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;27;This turning of the bobbin and the movement of the traveler twists and winds the yarn in one operation,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;28;The sliver is fed through a machine called the roving frame where the strands of fiber are further elongated and given additional twist,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;29;The predominant commercial systems of yarn formation are ring spinning and openend spinning,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;30;Openend spinning omits the roving step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;31;Openend spinning omits the roving step,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yarn;32;Instead a sliver of fibers is fed into the spinner by a stream of air,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;33;The sliver is delivered to a rotary beater that separates the fibers into a thin stream that is carried into the rotor by a current of air through a tube or duct and is deposited in a Vshaped groove along the sides of the rotor,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;34;As the rotor turns twist is produced,Relevant
MadeHow;Yarn;35;A constant stream of new fibers enters the rotor is distributed in the groove and is removed at the end of the formed yarn,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;1;The first yoyos manufactured in the United States were carved out of solid blocks of maple,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;2;This was a timeintensive but straight forward process,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;3;Lumber was first dried in huge kilns,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;4;This step is critical in the making of a wooden yoyo because wood warps and shrinks as it dries which is something that should happen before it is carved into the specific balanced shape of a yoyo,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;5;Once dried the lumber was cut down to size,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;6;It was then put on a lathe and using a master pattern to ensure the correct dimensions it was shaved with a variety of chisels into a yoyo,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;7;The yoyo was either stained with wood stain or painted and then it was finished with clear lacquer,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;8;Today most manufacturers of wooden yoyos still use this process except that very few make solid yoyos anymore,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;9;Most drill into the wooden halves and connect them with a steel axle,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;10;However the majority of yoyos made today are of plastic,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;11;That process has nine steps,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;12;Each half of a plastic yoyos is composed of two parts the outer shell and the inner disc,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;13;These two pieces are snapped together and an axle joins two halves to form a yoyo,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;14;Each half of a plastic yoyo begins as two pieces the flat inner piece that will take the axle is called the disc and the rounded outer piece is called the shell (the butterfly type yoyo is opposite with a rounded disc and a flat shell,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;15;It is made via the same process but on a separate assembly line),Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;16;The plastic used to make the discs and shells is fed in the form of solid pellets into a huge funnel with an equally huge screw inside,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;17;The outside of the funnel is wrapped with flexible strips called heater bands which are like narrow electric blankets for the funnel,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;18;Each band gets progressively warmer as the funnel gets narrower and as the screw pushes the pellets toward the bottom of the funnel they become more and more liquid,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;19;This process ensures that the pellets will melt evenly and completely which is critical to the next step,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;20;At the bottom of the funnel the screw pushes the liquid plastic into a mold through a tube called a gate,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;21;Inside the mold are the shapes of four discs and four shells all connected by gates,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;22;The mold has a valve which allows hot air to be pushed out ahead of the plastic and ensures that the mold is completely Wooden yoyos are made from lumber that has been dried to ensure the finished yoyo will not change shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;23;Modern wooden models have two wooden halves that are connected by a metal axle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;24;Wooden yoyos are made from lumber that has been dried to ensure the finished yoyo will not change shape,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;25;Modern wooden models have two wooden halves that are connected by a metal axle,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;26;Because the mold is completely filled and because the plastic has been entirely and evenly melted each shell and each disc will always be perfectly round and have perfectly even weight distribution,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;27;Once the mold is filled it holds the plastic for 17 seconds and cools it with waterfilled tubes running along the outside of the mold,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;28;Then the mold which is actually two halves clamped tightly together releases the shells and halves all connected by the plastic that filled the gates onto an assembly line to be fashioned into yoyo halves,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;29;While the molding line is making yoyo halves a separate machine is cutting the axles to connect them,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;30;The machine is fed long pieces of round metal,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;31;The exact length of metal to make an axle is fed into a clamp where it is cut,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;32;The cut piece is then notched at each end so that it will grip the plastic,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;33;Once the mold releases the flat of shells and discs a worker clips them apart removes any extra plastic and snaps them together to make halves,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;34;Each shell and disc has a lip that fits into its complimentary piece,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;35;When the plastic is still slightly warm from the mold these lips will snap together,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;36;Once fastened they will not release,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;37;The halves are sent down a belt to a machine called the hot stamper,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;38;The hot stamper has a circular tray with cuplike holders around its edge,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;39;Each holder takes a yoyo half and rotates it to a heated press,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;40;The press feeds a roll of whatever logo the yoyo will display onto the top of the yoyo half,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;41;It then presses the logo onto the half and heats it affixing the logo,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;42;Other designs use a round insert displaying the logo which fits into the disc and a clear shell so the insert can be seen,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;43;The halves continue down the line to a worker who places an axle in one half and sets it with a mallet,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;44;The next worker places the other half on top and sets it with a mallet,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;45;Then the assembled yoyo is placed in an airdriven press,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;46;The press has a tray in the shape of the yoyo and a metal plate that fits between the yoyo halves,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;47;The metal plate has a groove cut out to fit around the axle and is the exact thickness of the manufacturers specified gap between the halves,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;48;When the press fires it both permanently secures the two halves to the axle and sets the correct gap between the halves,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;49;The finished yoyo is now placed on a table with a spool of string and a cutter at one end and an upright with several notches in it at the other,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;50;The distance between the cutter and the upright is exactly the length of the manufacturers desired length of string for each yoyo,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;51;The string is pulled down from the spool through the notch in the upright where it is looped around the axle of the yoyo,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;52;Then it is pulled back to the cutter cut and tied,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;53;The yoyo is then allowed to hang from its string held by the notch in the upright to twist onto the axle,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;54;The strung yoyo moves down the line to a machine that resembles a miniature turntable,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;55;A worker places the yoyo on the wheel holds it down with one hand holds tension in the string with the other hand and with a footoperated switch spins the string onto the yoyo,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;56;The most common packaging for a yoyo is called a skin card,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;57;The skin card is the cardboard sheet with the product attached to it with what appears to be melted plastic wrap you see hanging on store displays,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;58;To package a yoyo this way a sheet of several cards is slid under a piece of wood with holes in it corresponding to the cards below,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;59;A yoyo is dropped through each hole onto the card,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;60;This assures correct placement on the card,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;61;The sheet then moves on rollers to a machine that feeds plastic film over the entire sheet of cards and yoyos,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;62;The film is made from a special plastic that conforms to any shape and shrinks when heated but does not melt,Irrelevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;63;The machine heats the plastic which tightly seals the yoyos to the cards,Relevant
MadeHow;Yoyo;64;The machine then cuts the sheet into individual cards and rolls them into a basket where they are collected and boxed for shipping,Relevant
